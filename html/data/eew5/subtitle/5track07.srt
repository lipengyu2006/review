00:00:02,128 --> 00:00:04,796
An Architect's Plan

2
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:08,512
An architect wanted to build a new office building.

3
00:00:08,512 --> 00:00:11,084
He selected some land that seemed perfect.

4
00:00:11,084 --> 00:00:14,419
He planned to cut down the trees to make room for the building.

5
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:17,849
But there was a problem ... a big problem.

6
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:21,724
The land was actually the habitat of several types of birds.

7
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:25,154
Some nature lovers were very upset with the architect.

8
00:00:25,154 --> 00:00:29,123
First, they held a rally and told others about the issue.

9
00:00:29,123 --> 00:00:35,253
Then, they decided to take legal action because the architect didn't respect the animals' rights.

10
00:00:35,253 --> 00:00:39,287
To resolve the problem, they asked a judge to intervene.

11
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:42,780
The judge could not call any witnesses for the nature lovers,

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,877
so he first asked the architect to tell his side of the story.

13
00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:51,419
"Why are you going to destroy the birds' habitat?" the judge asked.

14
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:55,389
The architect replied, "I have the deed to the land.

15
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,612
I want to make a great building there.

16
00:00:57,612 --> 00:01:02,217
As you may know, all my buildings become memorable landmarks."

17
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:04,885
Then one of the nature lovers spoke.

18
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:08,950
"We believe that there's no reason to destroy all the trees.

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,618
We just want to protect the birds."

20
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:14,286
The judge then made his decision.

21
00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:18,700
"I proclaim that the office building should be built," he said.

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,527
It is not a crime to remove those trees.

23
00:01:21,527 --> 00:01:27,879
I cannot give you a sentence for any offenses, but I feel obliged to make one request.

24
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,023
I will only allow you to use half of the land.

25
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:34,929
The other half will remain free so the birds have a place to live.

26
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:38,105
The nature lovers could not conceal their gratitude.

27
00:01:38,105 --> 00:01:40,074
All of the people cheered.

28
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:43,091
The architect said, "I have an idea.

29
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:47,347
I will volunteer my time and efforts to design a new type of building.

30
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:50,682
It will provide bushes on the roof where birds can live.

31
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:56,303
There are enough resources in my company's bank account to create the best building ever made."

32
00:01:56,303 --> 00:01:59,416
The architect did exactly as he had promised.

33
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:04,243
He built this new type of building, which was loved by everyone.
