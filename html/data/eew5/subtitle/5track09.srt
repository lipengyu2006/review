00:00:02,122 --> 00:00:04,805
Growing to be Great

2
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:09,111
When George was just a boy, he didn't have any parents.

3
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:12,418
The rumor was that they had died in a car accident.

4
00:00:12,418 --> 00:00:16,256
Many bad things could have happened to George, but he was lucky.

5
00:00:16,256 --> 00:00:19,906
He was sent to live alongside other children without parents.

6
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:24,649
There were kind people to assist George and help him go forward with his life.

7
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:28,861
However, he was a pessimistic and mean little boy.

8
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:34,072
George was often outraged. He told mean rumors about the other kids.

9
00:00:34,072 --> 00:00:37,785
He smashed furniture and even slapped other boys.

10
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:43,588
He defied anyone who tried to help him, and soon it was difficult for them to forgive him.

11
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:49,298
But George did display a love for one thing. He loved to play baseball.

12
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:57,504
Whereas he was lazy in school and liked neither the subjects nor the teachers, he was lively and happy when he played baseball.

13
00:00:57,504 --> 00:01:00,499
One of George's teachers noticed his talent.

14
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:05,397
He began to work with the boy. At first, they only talked about baseball.

15
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:09,766
The teacher watched George play. He was a very efficient hitter.

16
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:15,819
He almost never missed the ball. The teacher thought that George looked majestic when he played.

17
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:21,060
When George hit the ball, it flew through the breeze as if it would never come down.

18
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,493
In time, they began to talk about other things.

19
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:28,705
They talked about George's family and his dreams for the future.

20
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:31,388
They developed a very good relationship.

21
00:01:31,388 --> 00:01:34,383
As George got older, he began to grow.

22
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:39,937
His appetite was huge. He ate and ate. He got stronger.

23
00:01:39,937 --> 00:01:44,898
Soon the other boys and even the teachers looked small and feeble next to him.

24
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:49,141
Everyone thought that this was the start of a great baseball career.

25
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:56,286
When George got his first job as a baseball player, he gave most of his wages to the people who had helped him as a boy.

26
00:01:56,286 --> 00:02:01,715
He hoped that other children would also find a way to live happy successful lives.
