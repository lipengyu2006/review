The Big Race

2
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:08,057
Alex woke up scared because of a nightmare.

3
00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:14,122
In it, he was running a race. Just before he reached the finish line, he fell.

4
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:20,158
Alex thought that, in a subconscious way, his brain was trying to warn him about something.

5
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:27,279
He was going to run in a race that day. Did the dream mean he was going to lose? He became irritable.

6
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,435
"Good morning," said Alex's mother. "I brewed some coffee and made you a special breakfast."

7
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:38,776
Alex didn't want it. It had too much sugar. He needed something nutritious.

8
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:44,268
So he prepared a meal that contained a lot of protein to maximize his energy for the race.

9
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:48,493
Then his father asked, "Do you want help packing your stuff?"

10
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:54,347
"No," replied Alex. He wanted to make sure that he had all his equipment for the race.

11
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:57,787
Alex's family got in their van and drove to the track.

12
00:00:57,787 --> 00:01:04,305
When they arrived, a boy ran toward Alex. "Can I have your autograph?" asked the boy.

13
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:08,741
Alex had many fans. He usually charmed everybody he spoke to.

14
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:15,531
However, today Alex refused to give the boy his signature. He needed to think about his race.

15
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:19,393
He took his jump rope from his bag and started his usual workout.

16
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:23,105
Maybe exercising would help him forget about the nightmare.

17
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:29,533
"The race is about to start," said the coach. Beads of sweat formed all over Alex's body.

18
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:36,202
All he could think about was his terrible dream. He thought it might be his destiny to become a loser.

19
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:40,879
While he was thinking, he didn't hear the horn that meant the race had started.

20
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:47,186
The runners zoomed toward the finish line. By the time Alex started, he lagged far behind everyone.

21
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:50,173
He couldn't run fast enough to catch up to the others.

22
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:54,639
He had lost the race! He shouldn't have let the nightmare affect him.

23
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:57,627
He should have stayed focused on the race.
