The Black Plague

2
00:00:04,832 --> 00:00:13,774
In the 1300s, a grim disease known as the Black Plaque appalled the world, spreading rapidly from city to city like wildfire.

3
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:21,598
People from China to England fell ill -- no one was spared, as the disease struck young and old alike, without mercy.

4
00:00:21,598 --> 00:00:24,446
The incidence of death was terribly high.

5
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:30,900
One out of every three people in Europe perished; some, however, believe it to be one out of every two.

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:38,688
Overall, between 75 million and 200 million people passed away, greatly changing the demography of the region.

7
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:43,087
It would take 200 years before the population level rose again.

8
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:46,909
The Black Plague created fear that knew no bounds.

9
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:53,688
The first symptom to occur was the onset of a fever, quickly followed by a terrible pain in the patient's gut.

10
00:00:53,688 --> 00:01:00,286
The patient's skin then turned black, their armpits swelled, and blood poured out of their bodies.

11
00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:09,084
The victims were in great distress, which was worsened because those around them were afraid of any contact, making the victim's suffering even more horrible.

12
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:16,187
Loved ones would pray for a miracle with every dip in a family member's health, hoping they would escape the need to mourn them.

13
00:01:16,187 --> 00:01:24,083
Nothing could stop this terrible illness, and because so many people died, they had to be buried together in giant graves.

14
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:34,287
Without a proper or accurate diagnosis, physicians at the time were unaware of the existence of the herbs or other medicines that could cure or help the ailing people.

15
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:41,823
The doctors were negatively critiqued because of this perceived failing, so several efforts were made by others to find cures.

16
00:01:41,823 --> 00:01:44,203
Most of these efforts were nonsense.

17
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:51,017
For example, some believed that wearing special helmets shaped like birds would stave off or cure the disease.

18
00:01:51,017 --> 00:01:57,075
Other "cures" were dangerous and cruel -- people of different religions were burned alive,

19
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:01,798
as some thought that a religion was somehow responsible for the onset of the Plague.

20
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:07,459
The world in the 1300s was a dirty place in which few people bathed themselves.

21
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:11,065
Germs and bacteria were easily transmitted to others.

22
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:21,052
Rats were everywhere, and fleas living off the rats carried the Black Plague from house to house, defeating the population's most militant efforts to stop it.
