00:00:02,147 --> 00:00:05,104
Monkey Island

2
00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:10,420
In the middle of the ocean, there is a small island shaped like an arc.

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,292
Here, monkeys play on the beach and in the trees.

4
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:17,320
But how did the monkeys get there?

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,761
Once, an English admiral was exploring Africa when he found hundreds of monkeys.

6
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:26,366
The admiral had a mean character.

7
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:33,794
He thought, "I could sell these monkeys and become very rich! I'm going to take them to England."

8
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:37,878
So the admiral set traps to catch the monkeys.

9
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:43,193
He put stakes in the ground, tied string around them, and made loops in the string.

10
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:49,213
When the monkeys ran through the forest, their feet got caught in the loops, and they couldn't escape.

11
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:54,986
Then the admiral put the monkeys in cages on his ship and sailed away.

12
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:58,224
The cages were small and uncomfortable.

13
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:02,519
There was no soft hay and straw for the monkeys to sleep on.

14
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:09,630
Instead, the monkeys slept on branches with sharp thorns that cut into their flesh.

15
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,136
For dinner, he gave them tiny pieces of sour grapefruit to eat.

16
00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:17,199
The monkeys grew hungry and weak.

17
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:20,684
One day, the admiral hired a new steward.

18
00:01:20,684 --> 00:01:23,817
He was a kind man with a good conscience.

19
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:27,372
He was horrified to see the thin monkeys in the cages.

20
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:29,871
So one night, he let them out.

21
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:33,356
The monkeys ran and played all over the ship!

22
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:37,581
They attacked the admiral and the steward and ate their food.

23
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:40,186
They completely wrecked the ship.

24
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:44,903
One monkey ran into a kerosene lamp, and it fell over.

25
00:01:44,903 --> 00:01:48,423
The ship caught fire and began to sink!

26
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:52,260
The whole crew was lost except for the monkeys.

27
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,132
After the accident, the monkeys jumped onto a raft.

28
00:01:56,132 --> 00:01:59,582
They floated away from the fiery blaze of the ship.

29
00:01:59,582 --> 00:02:03,841
In the morning, they saw a little island in the distance.

30
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:08,453
The monkeys used a piece of wood as a paddle, and they went toward it.

31
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:11,480
They found the island shaped like an arc.

32
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,817
They felt so happy to find a new home, and they still live there today.
