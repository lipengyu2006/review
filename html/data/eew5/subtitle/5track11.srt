How a Singer Helped Win the War

2
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:08,598
Sometimes famous people are vain.

3
00:00:08,598 --> 00:00:10,830
They only care about themselves.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,357
But Josephine Baker was an exception.

5
00:00:13,357 --> 00:00:18,968
In the 1930s and 1940s, Baker was one of the most famous women in France.

6
00:00:18,968 --> 00:00:25,040
She was a big part of the new jazz genre and culture and had a diverse group of fans.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,304
The French people especially loved her.

8
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:34,721
And she loved France. So when World War II started, she wanted to help the nation that had given her so much.   

9
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:38,692
In 1940, armed German troops entered Paris.

10
00:00:38,692 --> 00:00:42,662
When this happened, some French people formed a secret alliance.

11
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:45,255
It was called the French Resistance.

12
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:47,716
The group worked for the defense of France.

13
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:51,589
It helped the European and American armies fight the Germans.

14
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:54,706
Baker was an important member of the Resistance.

15
00:00:54,706 --> 00:01:00,712
She had three jobs. The first was to carry messages to and from other members.

16
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:04,191
The messages were written in code on her sheets of music.

17
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:08,949
The second was to provide shelter and supply goods to Resistance members.

18
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:11,870
It would have been dangerous if the Germans found them.

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,889
Baker's third job was the most important.

20
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:18,926
Baker held concerts for European politicians and army members.

21
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:22,404
She lured them in, promising an entertaining show.

22
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:27,130
She enchanted them with her singing and dancing, and got lots of applause.

23
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,166
But Baker was always equipped with a small notebook at these concerts.

24
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:35,236
She listened for details about the war and wrote them down.

25
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:39,994
Baker sorted the details and gave authoritative reports to the Resistance.

26
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:42,751
Some thought Baker's fame would be an obstacle.

27
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:48,297
The Germans knew who she was, but they didn't think she was smart enough to work for the Resistance.

28
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:51,415
So she could get information from the Germans easily.

29
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:56,206
This helped the Resistance and the French army save lives and win the war.

30
00:01:56,206 --> 00:01:59,685
Baker had a big impact on the Resistance's work.

31
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:02,376
She got many awards for her help.

32
00:02:02,376 --> 00:02:08,283
When she died, the army had a special ceremony to thank her again for her bravery.
