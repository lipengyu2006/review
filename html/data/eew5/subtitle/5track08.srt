Janie and the Music Player

2
00:00:05,643 --> 00:00:10,120
Janie had constant thoughts about getting a music player.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,669
One day, she was late to class.

4
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:17,875
She hurried down the hall but halted when she saw a backpack on the floor.

5
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:21,624
She looked inside and found nothing but some books.

6
00:00:21,624 --> 00:00:26,284
She reached inside the bag and felt a small object at the bottom.

7
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:30,143
It was a music player enclosed in a black case!

8
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:35,931
Janie tended to be honest, and she had no valid reason to take the device.

9
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:40,810
However, her desire for the player influenced her decision.

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,450
She slyly put the device into her own backpack.

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:50,712
When she arrived at class, she gave her teacher the bag. "I found this," she said.

12
00:00:50,712 --> 00:00:55,299
Ms. Johnson asked, "Does this backpack belong to anyone?"

13
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:58,174
A girl named Linda claimed the bag.

14
00:00:58,174 --> 00:01:04,400
Linda looked inside and yelled, "My music player is missing! Janie took it!"

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,640
Janie answered, "I did not."

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,591
Linda responded, "You were the only one that had access to it!

17
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:18,051
If your version of the story is true, you'll let Ms. Johnson check your bag."

18
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:24,058
Janie started to perspire as she realized the impending trouble she was in.

19
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:31,994
She gripped her bag tightly. Ms. Johnson took the bag from Janie. Inside she found the player.

20
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:37,564
"Janie, I never expected this kind of conduct from you," she said.

21
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:43,389
"You've always been such a good student." Ms. Johnson gave Linda the player.

22
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:49,068
Linda said, "Ms. Johnson, look!" There was a crack along one side.

23
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:52,927
She turned it to the "on" mode, but it wouldn't work.

24
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:57,441
It must've snapped while Janie was holding onto the bag so tightly.

25
00:01:57,441 --> 00:02:02,429
Ms. Johnson called Janie's parents. They were very upset.

26
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:08,945
"Stealing is illegal. You have no respect for the law whatsoever," they said.

27
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:16,371
"We bought you a music player, but we're giving it to Linda. It will replace the one you broke."

28
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:22,524
In the end, Janie's bad behavior left her with nothing at all.
