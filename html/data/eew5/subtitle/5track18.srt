The School Play

2
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:11,999
Peter was excited. Next week he was going to audition for the school play.

3
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:18,526
Everybody knew he was a great actor. He was sure he would get the lead role.

4
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:24,601
Later, his friend Robby asked him, "Have you seen the script for the play?"

5
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:31,544
"Yes. The title is The Lost Glove -- it's a comic play," replied Peter.

6
00:00:31,544 --> 00:00:39,354
Robby said, "I want to play the part of the hermit because the hermit gets to talk with an accent!"

7
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:48,900
"I want the lead role of the barber. I didn't know you liked acting. I thought you liked choir better," said Peter.

8
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,881
"Acting is also a hobby of mine. Do you want to practice with me?

9
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:59,352
The basement at my house is quiet. It's perfect!" Robby replied.

10
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:06,521
"I don't like practicing with others. It complicates the process for me," said Peter.

11
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:14,105
Actually, Peter didn't want to practice at all. The teacher would surely reserve the lead part for him.

12
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:17,840
A few days later, Robby came to his house.

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:26,745
Robby said, "Do you want to practice the scene on the staircase? It's the part where the migrant searches for a new job."

14
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:33,122
Peter declined the invitation. "I can't today. I need to do some errands."

15
00:01:33,122 --> 00:01:40,781
Then he slammed the door. It was just an excuse. Peter didn't want to help Robby.

16
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:48,894
On the day of auditions, Peter wore his lucky leather jacket. He always got the best part when he wore it.

17
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:55,987
The teacher told him to begin, but his mind was blank. He couldn't remember the lines!

18
00:01:55,987 --> 00:02:04,137
A week later, the teacher put a list of the parts on the wall. Peter read the list, looking for his name.

19
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:13,721
He was shocked by what he saw. He blinked his eyes and looked again. He didn't get the lead part -- Robby did!

20
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:21,041
Peter pondered the situation and came to the idea that Robby justly received the part.

21
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:28,172
He earned it by practicing. Next time, Peter would practice, too.
