1
00:00:02,052 --> 00:00:04,526
The Sun and the North Wind

2
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:10,947
The Sun and the North Wind were talking to each other in the sky.

3
00:00:10,947 --> 00:00:15,105
The North Wind was saying that he was better than everyone else.

4
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:26,814
The Sun listened as the North Wind talked with enthusiasm about how powerful he was and how he could push something from one continent to another with one breath.

5
00:00:26,814 --> 00:00:31,283
He said, "I am the strongest thing in the sky."

6
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:34,505
"Really?" asked the Sun.

7
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:41,157
"How do you know that you are more powerful than the stars, or the rain, or even me?"

8
00:00:41,157 --> 00:00:44,171
The North Wind laughed with disrespect.

9
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:49,714
He yelled, "You? That's a joke!" This hurt the Sun.

10
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:53,975
He was usually timid and did not want to cause conflict.

11
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:58,894
Today he decided that he should teach the North Wind a lesson.

12
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:04,091
In the meantime, a man began walking along an avenue down on Earth.

13
00:01:04,091 --> 00:01:08,525
When the Sun looked down on the terrain below, he saw the man.

14
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:14,138
He pointed down to the Earth and said, "Do you see that man walking below?

15
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:18,122
I bet I can get his jacket off of him. Can you?"

16
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:25,189
"Of course!" the North Wind replied as he took a deep breath and filled his lungs with air.

17
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:32,222
He used all of the muscles in his face and belly to blow winds at his target in succession.

18
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:41,160
The harsh air currents made the man cold. The man pulled his jacket more tightly around him. It did not come off.

19
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,114
The Sun decided to rescue the man from the mischief of the North Wind.

20
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:53,181
He said, "May I try?" Then he sent down sunlight that made the man warm.

21
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:59,244
The man leaned against a tree. He took off his jacket and enjoyed the nice weather.

22
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:04,163
"You are very powerful," the Sun said to the North Wind,

23
00:02:04,163 --> 00:02:10,607
"but you use violence in your bid to appear strong. You should think of an alternative.

24
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:15,561
The strongest people don't use force to get what they want."
