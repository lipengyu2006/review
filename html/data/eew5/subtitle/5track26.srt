Jane's Pride

2
00:00:04,989 --> 00:00:12,021
Jane and her father, Mike, owned a secondhand boat. They called it "High Hopes."

3
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:18,257
The two loved to spend time together on the ocean and would often go on long fishing trips.

4
00:00:18,257 --> 00:00:26,052
Mike taught Jane how to perform important tasks. Jane learned how to steer the boat and adjust the sails.

5
00:00:26,052 --> 00:00:34,436
She learned how to put grease on the gears of the motor. She learned how to lift the anchor and secure it by putting a rope in a slot.

6
00:00:34,436 --> 00:00:40,152
Jane liked helping her father, but she thought that she wasn't very good at it.

7
00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:45,522
Sometimes, she omitted important steps and made frequent mistakes.

8
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:51,827
Jane thought she wasn't capable of manual labor and did not have the knowledge she needed.

9
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:57,266
Mike wanted to prove to her that she was indeed capable and important.

10
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:06,066
He thought of a tactic to test Jane's skills in the context of an emergency. He hid under the deck and pretended to be trapped.

11
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:13,341
He shouted, "Jane, I can't get out! You have to get back to the dock and find help!"

12
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:20,928
Jane began to panic. She thought she might make her usual mistakes, which would cause a disaster.

13
00:01:20,928 --> 00:01:29,138
However, she had to listen to her dad and act accordingly. She pulled up the anchor with all of her energy.

14
00:01:29,138 --> 00:01:38,042
She remembered to overlap the sails to offset the wind. She steered the boat around the harbor where the water was shallow.

15
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:45,698
When they got to shore, Mike came out from under the deck. Jane said, "I thought you were trapped!"

16
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:54,532
Mike laughed. He said, "It wasn't a genuine emergency. I distorted the truth to test your abilities.

17
00:01:54,532 --> 00:02:00,838
Look at what a great job you did getting the boat home safely! I knew you could do it."

18
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:11,265
To honor his daughter, Mike decided to rename his boat. He designated it "Jane's Pride" and painted the name on the front of the ship.

19
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:15,596
Jane finally had something to be proud of.
