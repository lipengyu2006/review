The Heirs

2
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:13,176
Martin, Paul, and Tom were brothers. They were very different, but they were consistent about two things.

3
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:18,092
They couldn't succeed in business, and they never agreed about anything.

4
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:24,700
Martin was a hardworking farmer, growing organic vegetables and raising poultry.

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:33,122
But he was disorganized and forgot to pay his bills. Paul owned a textile factory that produced clothes.

6
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:39,125
He was organized, but he was greedy and used too much for his own clothing.

7
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:45,774
His wardrobe was filled with his own products. Tom was once a sergeant in the army.

8
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:54,155
He ran a martial arts school, but his stance on discipline was too strong. He had almost no students.

9
00:00:54,155 --> 00:01:02,053
One day, they received a telegraph saying that their father had died. They were heirs to his old farm.

10
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:09,104
They planned to sell it as soon as possible, so they went to see it even though there was a terrible storm.

11
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:18,452
The house didn't look great, but there was a lot of land. There was so much, in fact, that they could barely see its boundary.

12
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:25,665
Suddenly, the storm got worse. The sheer force of the wind almost knocked them over.

13
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:36,988
Martin said, "Look, it's a typhoon!" Paul said, "No, it's a cyclone." Tom said, "No, it's a tornado!"

14
00:01:36,988 --> 00:01:45,852
They argued until Paul began to wail and said, "Whatever it is, it's coming right at us! We're doomed!"

15
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:49,519
The three brothers scrambled inside the old house.

16
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:57,779
Martin said, "If we survive, we must stop fighting. This farm could be great if we fixed it up.

17
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:05,677
With my hard work, Paul's organization, and Tom's discipline, we could run a great business together!"

18
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:11,117
The storm finally ended. And luckily, it didn't wreck the farm.

19
00:02:11,117 --> 00:02:17,926
"Just think," Martin said, "it took the chaos of a typhoon to bring us together."

20
00:02:17,926 --> 00:02:28,161
Paul replied, "You mean a cyclone brought us together." Tom said, "Didn't I tell you both that it was a tornado?"

21
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:37,872
The brothers never agreed on what kind of storm it was, but by combining their skills, they started a successful farm.
