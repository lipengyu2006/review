00:00:02,157 --> 00:00:05,270
Laika, the Space Dog

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,109
One of the world's most beloved space travelers was also the furriest.

3
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:13,869
Laika was a little dog living on the streets of Moscow, Russia.

4
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:17,382
She matured on the streets because no one would give her a home.

5
00:00:17,382 --> 00:00:23,516
She had to learn how to live without eating much. She found ways to keep warm in a very cold climate.

6
00:00:23,516 --> 00:00:29,094
Scientists thought a tough dog like Laika would do well in a project they were putting together.

7
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:34,149
In a prior launch, Russia had put the first man-made object into space.

8
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:38,433
Now, scientists wanted to see if a living thing could go into space.

9
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:45,244
Although many facts about space had been learned, they weren't enough to help send humans into space safely yet.

10
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:49,898
Laika and two other dogs were chosen to help scientists with their research.

11
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:56,092
The animals were used in a variety of tests. In the end, though, only Laika would go into space.

12
00:00:56,092 --> 00:01:01,609
On November 3, 1957 the Sputnik 2 spaceship was due to leave Earth.

13
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:08,390
Scientists carefully applied wires to Laika's skin to measure her body's reactions once she got into space.

14
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:14,122
Laika also wore a special leash. Without it,she would float around in the spaceship.

15
00:01:14,122 --> 00:01:20,471
Soon after, Laika left the planet. Scientists on Earth awaited information from the ship.

16
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:24,940
But in the midst of so much excitement, something very sad happened.

17
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,008
Scientists were able to tell that Laika was under a lot of stress.

18
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:34,926
The trip confused and scared her. Laika's entire ship had become as hot as a furnace.

19
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:41,429
Scientists were powerless to help the dog in her misery. After about five hours, Laika died.

20
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:45,651
Some have complained that the little dog should never have been used in the mission.

21
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:48,980
Scientists knew that she would not survive the trip.

22
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,510
Laika was never buried, but a memorial has been established in Moscow.

23
00:01:53,510 --> 00:02:00,229
There are many songs and books about her, too. It seems that Laika became a hero to many people.
