The History of Chocolate

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,389
Many people believe that chocolate originally came from Europe.

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:15,080
However, chocolate, called the "food of the gods," was first made in the Americas.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,678
The first chocolate was very different from contemporary chocolate.

5
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:24,373
Wild chocolate trees can grow easily in the humid Amazon rainforest.

6
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:28,424
Clusters of flowers growing on these trees turn to seeds.

7
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:32,507
About 20 to 60 cacao beans can be found each seed.

8
00:00:32,507 --> 00:00:39,163
Cacao beans are the ingredient needed to create sweet, soothing, and delicious chocolate treats.

9
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:45,208
The Mayan and Aztec cultures both thought that chocolate trees were brought from paradise by gods.

10
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:52,443
The Mayans and Aztecs used the beans from this divine tree to create a special beverage with a very pleasant odor.

11
00:00:52,443 --> 00:00:57,716
Surprisingly, the Aztecs believed that it was toxic to women and children.

12
00:00:57,716 --> 00:01:02,410
In the 1500s, the Spanish explorer Cortes met the Aztecs.

13
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:08,327
Cortes became quite interested in the plantations where the Aztecs cultivated chocolate trees.

14
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:11,992
When he returned to Europe, he took cacao beans with him.

15
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:16,429
He introduced the people of Spain to the Aztecs' chocolate beverage.

16
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:23,182
Over the next 100 years or so, kings, queens, and members of the upper class enjoyed drinking chocolate.

17
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:27,040
They enjoyed it even more once they learned to add sugar to the beverage!

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,030
Soon, chocolate had spread all across Europe.

19
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,365
New machines allowed chocolate makers to perfect their products and produce them at a very rapid rate.

20
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:40,802
Preparing the beans in special ways brought out the aroma of chocolate.

21
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:46,332
The beans were combined with condensed milk to give the chocolate a smooth texture.

22
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:52,281
Today, contemporary chocolates with subtle flavors fill the shelves of chocolate shops.

23
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:56,107
The different types of chocolate available today vary widely.

24
00:01:56,107 --> 00:01:59,323
True chocolate lovers can tell which is best, though.

25
00:01:59,323 --> 00:02:06,043
They will tell you that the flavor of high-quality chocolate stays on the palate long after you finish it.
