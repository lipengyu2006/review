Gwen's New Friends

2
00:00:05,518 --> 00:00:14,243
Gwen walked into the gym for her next class. Coach Peeves said, "Today, we're playing basketball.

3
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:21,849
The custom is to let you choose your own teams. However, we're going to do things differently."

4
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:27,591
The coach assigned each girl to a team. There were six girls per team.

5
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:32,363
Gwen glimpsed at her teammates. She didn't know any of them.

6
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:38,403
All of her friends were on the other teams. She couldn't believe her misfortune.

7
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:47,128
"I feel sick. May I go to the nurse?" asked Gwen. The coach could see through Gwen's excuses.

8
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:54,921
It wasn't the first time Gwen tried to leave class. With a stern voice, the coach said, "No."

9
00:00:54,921 --> 00:01:03,795
Gwen was vehement. "I don't know any of these girls! Let me play on another team. Please!" she pleaded.

10
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:10,879
"Gwen, don't be disobedient. I don't want to hear any more negative comments from you."

11
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:21,505
Gwen had no choice. Then a girl smiled at her. "Hi, I'm Stephanie. I was in your English class last year" she said.

12
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:30,230
Gwen remembered her. "For the sake of the team, please try your best. I know you're a good player," said Stephanie.

13
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,517
When the game started, Gwen played as best as she could.

14
00:01:34,517 --> 00:01:40,334
She took a long shot. The ball sailed through the air and went right through the hoop!

15
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:48,089
"That was awesome!" said one of her teammates. Later, Gwen fel with a loud thump.

16
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:55,173
"Are you OK?" asked her teammates. They were worried. She had ripped her pants.

17
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:58,715
She had scraped her knee and had a small bruise.

18
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:06,582
Gwen told her teammates, "My knee is fine, and I can stitch my pants later. Let's keep playing!"

19
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:14,114
By the end of the game, Gwen forgot altogether that she hadn't wanted to play, and her team won!

20
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:17,246
The victory bound Gwen's team together.

21
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:26,232
She had made a lot of new friends, and she could foresee that they would be a source of happiness for her for many years.
