The Singing Emperor

2
00:00:05,276 --> 00:00:14,123
Nero was emperor of Rome from 54 CE to 68 CE, when a coup put an end to his young life.

3
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:23,376
For some, he was a powerful ruler of incredible glamour, yet the consensus among most Romans was that he was a terrible emperor;

4
00:00:23,376 --> 00:00:30,316
some even called him a beast and used the numbers 666 as a code for his name.

5
00:00:30,316 --> 00:00:35,145
Even today, this number is a symbol of the devil for many people.

6
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:41,395
The chapels near the graves of the people Nero killed are some of the most famous churches in the world,

7
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:45,778
but there was never a cry of outrage over the grave of Nero.

8
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:49,755
Why did commentators think that Nero was so bad?

9
00:00:49,755 --> 00:01:00,306
He was a cynical man who harassed every member of his family, killing his stepfather, stepbrother, stepsister, wife, and even his own mother.

10
00:01:00,306 --> 00:01:08,098
He first tried to drown her in the sea, but she swam to safety, so he sent an assassin to finish the job.

11
00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:14,511
He tried to con the Roman people into believing that he was sorry, yet no one did.

12
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:18,488
Soon afterward, most of Rome burned in a fire.

13
00:01:18,488 --> 00:01:24,778
The tragedy inflamed the people, and many thought that Nero was the one who had started the blaze.

14
00:01:24,778 --> 00:01:30,338
Some say he even sang the melodies of well-known songs while the capital burned.

15
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:35,127
Nero blamed Christians for the fire and tortured them to death.

16
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:42,878
After the fire, Nero built a beautiful palace with a giant dome over it, calling it his Golden House.

17
00:01:42,878 --> 00:01:54,201
A giant statue sporting Nero's hairdo and beard stood over the palace, which also had a large swimming pool and a garden that was illuminated by burning lamps.

18
00:01:54,201 --> 00:02:00,369
Nero built a long bridge to join the palace to the forum, Rome's central market.

19
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:05,199
He would sing songs on the rooftop and entertain anyone who listened.

20
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:11,205
Many enjoyed his glamorous style, but others hated him for his selfishness.

21
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:17,252
Nero's reign came to an abrupt end when the army organized a conspiracy against him.

22
00:02:17,252 --> 00:02:22,447
The soldiers wanted a new emperor, and everyone left Nero to die.

23
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:29,711
While stabbing himself in the neck, he exclaimed in agony, "What a great artist the world is losing!"

24
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:39,694
Soon after, a war began. When it was over, the new emperor tore down the hated Golden House of Nero forever.
