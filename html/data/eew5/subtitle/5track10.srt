Anton's Great Discovery

2
00:00:05,628 --> 00:00:10,026
Anton Van Leeuwenhoek was a Dutch cloth merchant.

3
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:15,691
His life began to change after he got his first microscope in 1653.

4
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:20,798
It was a very simple microscope. It had a lens in an upright stand.

5
00:00:20,798 --> 00:00:26,836
It could make small things look large. It was handy for looking closely at cloth.

6
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:32,166
Soon, Anton felt a longing to build a more powerful microscope.

7
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:36,265
He dreamed of using it to make an important scientific discovery.

8
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:41,074
He wanted to become famous. Three decades later, he did.

9
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:45,770
For many years, Anton experimented with microscopes and lenses.

10
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,795
Eventually, he constructed a very powerful microscope.

11
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:54,752
If he had sold the concept to others, it would have made him very rich.

12
00:00:54,752 --> 00:00:59,635
However Anton refrained from surrendering his secret to anyone.

13
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:03,362
Instead, he wanted to use it to become famous.

14
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:08,207
So he used his secret microscope to study the natural world.

15
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:13,090
One day, he was looking at saliva from his mouth with the microscope.

16
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,966
In the saliva, he saw numerous tiny particles.

17
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:22,781
Some of them were moving! He thought that the particles were tiny organisms.

18
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:28,297
So he isolated them from each other and studied each one carefully.

19
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:31,763
Then he classified them into different categories.

20
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:37,578
Some were round. Others were long and had tails. All were alive.

21
00:01:37,578 --> 00:01:42,497
Anton was so excited. He knew he could become famous now.

22
00:01:42,497 --> 00:01:46,299
He was the first person to see these tiny organisms.

23
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:52,673
So he drew diagrams of the organisms and sent them to a group of scientists in London.

24
00:01:52,673 --> 00:02:00,276
The scientists were sophisticated men who did not believe tiny, animate organisms could live in our mouths.

25
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:05,979
Anton made a plea for them to come to Holland to see the organisms with their own eyes.

26
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:09,669
The men took a ferry to Holland and met Anton.

27
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:17,086
They performed a careful review of his work, and they conceded that he had made a worthwhile discovery.

28
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:20,999
Anton Van Leeuwenhoek had discovered bacteria.

29
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:25,956
After decades of hard work, he had become famous.
