The Teller and the Thieves

2
00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:11,405
A teller at a bank suspected some of her fellow employees of not being very trustworthy.

3
00:00:11,405 --> 00:00:17,934
She thought they were stealing. In order to catch them, though, she needed some way to link them to the crime.

4
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,992
She had a background in religion and folklore.

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,245
She remembered that one religion's literature had a myth that chronicled how a group of thieves was captured.

6
00:00:27,245 --> 00:00:33,168
In the millennium-old story, coins of copper were covered with venom taken from a poisonous snake.

7
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:36,143
The coins were left as bait for the robbers.

8
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:40,826
When they touched the coins, the venom infected their bodies through their skin.

9
00:00:40,826 --> 00:00:46,722
The venom ran through their veins, and they all became very sick as if they had a disease.

10
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:52,011
It made their skin purple. The police arrested whoever had purple skin.

11
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:55,702
She knew she couldn't use venom because it might hurt someone.

12
00:00:55,702 --> 00:01:02,837
However, she thought of a way to update the old story. She decided to cover a sum of money with a special powder.

13
00:01:02,837 --> 00:01:06,942
If people touched the money, the powder would cause their skin to itch.

14
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:12,810
She placed the stack of money in the bank's safe. No one was supposed to take money from the safe.

15
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,088
If somebody did, then they had to be stealing.

16
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:21,157
Within a few hours, three of her coworkers were scratching their hands and arms.

17
00:01:21,157 --> 00:01:26,859
They itched so badly that they couldn't even work. She checked the money, and it was gone.

18
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:33,140
She told her boss what she had done, and he had the thieves arrested. He thanked her and promoted her.

19
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,705
Because events from history often repeat, ancient literature had helped the teller solve a crime.

20
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:47,493
She proved that stories from the past still relate to the problems of today, and they can be helpful in solving those problems.
