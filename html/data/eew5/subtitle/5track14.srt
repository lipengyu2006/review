The Brothers and the Bread

2
00:00:05,642 --> 00:00:09,588
Two brothers wanted to go outside and play.

3
00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:17,253
However, because the only bread in the house was stale, their mother told them they needed to bake fresh bread.

4
00:00:17,253 --> 00:00:24,917
"I have to have the car repaired," she said. "When I return, if the bread is ready, you can play."

5
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:32,451
The brothers hurried to prepare the bread, but they were not careful enough. They didn't sift the flour.

6
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:37,082
They were careless and sprinkled too much salt into the mixture.

7
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:44,583
The dough needed to be soft and flexible, but the salt made it into a lump that was as hard as a brick.

8
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:50,779
The younger brother uttered a sigh. "Now we have to start again," he said.

9
00:00:50,779 --> 00:01:00,368
"No, we don't," the older brother replied. "I'll fix it. I just need to make the dough flat again and add water to it."

10
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:05,293
He decided to hit the ball of dough with his fist to make it flat.

11
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:13,055
But he hit it so hard that it flew right off of the table and knocked over a glass, which shattered.

12
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:18,371
The dough then crashed into the kitchen window's shutters and crumbled.

13
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:24,274
Luckily, the brothers were not injured, but they had made a huge mess.

14
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:28,742
A slight mistake now had become a major problem.

15
00:01:28,742 --> 00:01:34,123
The brothers had ruined the kitchen. Just then their mother returned.

16
00:01:34,123 --> 00:01:40,907
She saw the mess and became flushed with anger. "Now you can't play," she said.

17
00:01:40,907 --> 00:01:49,190
"Instead, you have to clean the kitchen. I want this kitchen to be so clean that it sparkles!"

18
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:54,604
The brothers cleaned the floor and expressed their sorrow to their mother.

19
00:01:54,604 --> 00:02:01,029
Soon, they were reconciled. But there was no bread, and it was too late to play.

20
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:06,900
They realized that trying to do something quickly often makes more work.
