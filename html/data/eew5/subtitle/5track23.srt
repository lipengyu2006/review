How the Dinosaurs Really Died

2
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:13,401
Many scientists and intellectuals think that dinosaurs died when an asteroid smashed into the Earth millions of years ago.

3
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:20,434
However, recently, there has been some controversy over this theory. Some scientists think that it isn't accurate.

4
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:26,263
They think that a tiny insect may have been the biggest factor in the death of these huge creatures.

5
00:00:26,263 --> 00:00:33,486
That insect was the mosquito. These scientists do think that an asteroid hit the Earth in the time of the dinosaurs.

6
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:41,090
But that wasn't what killed all of them. At that time, insects, including the mosquito, were beginning to evolve.

7
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:47,616
Today, we can regulate the number of mosquitoes with pesticides. But that was impossible millions of years ago.

8
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:52,527
The mosquitoes multiplied quickly. And they were certainly not idle.

9
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:57,405
Since there were so many mosquitoes, it was easy for them to bite many of the dinosaurs.

10
00:00:57,405 --> 00:01:05,516
When they bit another living thing, the mosquitoes passed along a deadly disease. So the dinosaurs were stricken with the disease.

11
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:10,268
The vast majority of them -- from the vegetarians to the meat eaters -- died.

12
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:15,368
To reinforce this idea, scientists stress how gradually the dinosaurs died.

13
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:22,085
If an asteroid had killed them, they would have died very quickly. But the number of dinosaurs decreased slowly.

14
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:26,868
In addition, scientists have found genetic material of mosquitoes in fossils.

15
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:30,480
This material proves that mosquitoes existed back then.

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,594
Although there may have been other factors, the dinosaurs died mainly because of disease, the scientists say.

17
00:01:36,594 --> 00:01:44,705
No matter how it happened, the dinosaurs' death had a major impact on other living things. Many dinosaurs ate mammals.

18
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:51,770
After the dinosaurs died, mammals were able to evolve and produce offspring. Birds also evolved.

19
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:59,531
Scientists have analyzed the genomes of birds and have discovered that birds have identical genetic material to some dinosaurs.

20
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:04,188
So, there may still be dinosaurs among us after all.
