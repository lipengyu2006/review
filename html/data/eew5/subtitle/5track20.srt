Climbing Kilimanjaro

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:17,610
With great ambition, it is now possible for everyone in good health to attempt climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro (5,895m).

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:27,545
The path to the top of Africa's tallest mountain has many cabins for climbers to use, while other routes have caves where people can camp.

4
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:36,467
Unlike other mighty mountains such as Everest and K2 in the Himalayas, Kilimanjaro can be climbed even by novices.

5
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:43,324
For this reason, a growing contingent of people who are fond of adventure are coming to Tanzania.

6
00:00:43,324 --> 00:00:51,155
Still, not every optimist's dreams will come true, and several will be forced to turn back mid-hike.

7
00:00:51,155 --> 00:01:01,129
What impairs some climbers and makes others successful? Kilimanjaro is only for people who are sufficiently prepared.

8
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:06,271
If you become ill, there is no ambulance to take you to the hospital.

9
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:14,960
Instead, your guides will have to haul you down the mountain if you break your ankle or have difficulty breathing the thin mountain air.

10
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,765
For this reason, burning calories by exercising before the trip is vital.

11
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:29,687
Healthy nutrition is also strongly recommended in order to ensure you have ample energy and are as strong as possible.

12
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:38,492
Some people exert themselves too much by attempting to rush to the top, acting as if they were trying to meet a deadline.

13
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:44,647
These impatient climbers often turn back due to exhaustion and sickness.

14
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:51,699
Instead, those who flank the group and proceed slowly are more likely to get to the top.

15
00:01:51,699 --> 00:02:03,816
Guides make efforts to forbid people from climbing too quickly, constantly whispering "pole, pole," which means "slowly, slowly" in Kiswahili.

16
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:08,725
Those who successfully haul themselves to the top have a great reward.

17
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:17,958
The views are breathtaking. Sadly, because of global warming, much of the ice on the mountaintop has melted in recent years.

18
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:21,270
Before long, there will be none left at all.

19
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:32,763
For this reason, many people are marking their calendars and planning trips to Tanzania, hoping to see the beauty of the icy summit before it's too late.
