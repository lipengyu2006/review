Becoming a Healer

2
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:13,871
Years ago, I worked at a small health clinic in a remote country. I had gone there to treat an obscure syndrome.

3
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:18,820
It attacked people's lungs, causing them to need a machine to breathe.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,202
I was trying out a new medication to treat these people instead of using the machine.

5
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:33,630
If I was successful, I would become famous. Everything was going fine until war broke out in a nearby country.

6
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,253
Many people from that country fled the hostile invading army.

7
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:44,105
The army wanted to dominate the people, but the people didn't want to be oppressed.

8
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:49,740
So they walked hundreds of miles across the dry sandy land to get away.

9
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:56,820
Some of these people came to our clinic for treatment. I talked with them and learned of their difficulties.

10
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:04,658
They did not beg or complain. I was impressed by their dignity. There was one woman I will never forget.

11
00:01:04,658 --> 00:01:10,799
Her son suffered from a shortage of food and stomach pain, and she didn't know what to do.

12
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,567
Neither did I. I was not skillful at treating lack of food.

13
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:24,851
Nonetheless, when I saw her sadness, I knew I had to help her son. The woman had been feeding her son bread and water.

14
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:32,978
She had an incorrect belief that it would be enough for him. However, I knew that he needed to eat vegetables, too.

15
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:38,613
So I took her outside and showed her a dense patch of plants you could eat.

16
00:01:38,613 --> 00:01:43,923
I taught her how to dig up the roots, peel them, and cook them for her son.

17
00:01:43,923 --> 00:01:48,691
I explained that she should increase her son's intake of these vegetables.

18
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:55,338
Likewise, she should try to get him some meat once a week to help him regain his strength.

19
00:01:55,338 --> 00:02:02,815
I sent her off with a prescription for some pain medicine, but she also left my office with some new cooking skills.

20
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:09,353
This was progress. A few weeks later, she returned to tell me her son was healthy again.

21
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:21,418
As thanks, she gave me a beautiful earthen bowl. I never became famous, but I kept that bowl to remind me what it truly means to heal someone.
