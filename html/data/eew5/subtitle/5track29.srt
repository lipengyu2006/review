The Solar Car Race

2
00:00:05,064 --> 00:00:12,339
We live in a mobile society. But the cars we drive require too much gas; plus, they pollute the air.

3
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:16,409
Eventually, the natural resources used to make gas will run out.

4
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:22,146
So, what happens then? Many people think solar-powered automobiles are the answer.

5
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:32,017
To learn more about this type of transportation, teams from universities and corporate organizations gather in Australia every two years for a solar car race.

6
00:00:32,017 --> 00:00:39,099
The race is called the World Solar Challenge. Candidates for this tournament must design their own cars.

7
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:46,438
The teams keep all their plans confidential. They don't interact with other teams because the race is very competitive.

8
00:00:46,438 --> 00:00:53,137
And these cars aren't just enhanced and modified versions of normal cars. They are completely different.

9
00:00:53,137 --> 00:01:00,828
The cars only have room for one person and are very simple inside -- they don't even have a cushion for the driver to sit on.

10
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:04,738
These cars are shorter and much more flatter than normal cars.

11
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:10,860
Most importantly, the outside of the cars incorporate solar panels that lie parallel to each other.

12
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,628
These panels are made from materials that take in light from the sun and turn it into electric energy.

13
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:24,256
The cars use this energy to move. These cars race over 3,000 kilometers across the Australian territories.

14
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:30,409
The drivers have to follow strict guidelines. They must stop at certain intervals to charge their batteries.

15
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:36,947
And unlike normal race cars, they can't go very fast. They have to drive at the normal speed limits.

16
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:41,658
Although the drivers want to finish the race quickly, that is not the main goal.

17
00:01:41,658 --> 00:01:46,530
The objective is to see how well the cars work under normal driving conditions.

18
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,946
Because of the World Solar Challenge, a new era in car making and driving is beginning.

19
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:58,388
People may ridicule the solar cars because they look strange, but this is a phenomenon that isn't going away.

20
00:01:58,388 --> 00:02:05,470
Using the technology from the vehicles, car makers will eventually create solar cars for the rest of us.
