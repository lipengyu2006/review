Gilbert and the Lizard

2
00:00:04,946 --> 00:00:13,157
Eliza disliked Australia. Firstly, she'd had to spend twenty uncomfortable hours on an aircraft getting here.

3
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:20,082
She wanted to go to the beach, but her husband was a zoology professor and wanted to look for some interesting animals.

4
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:29,546
So now she was traversing a swamp in the midday heat. "Let me sit down, Gilbert. I'm not hardy like you," she said, eventually.

5
00:00:29,546 --> 00:00:36,866
They sat under a tree. There were lots of birds in that secluded, rural place, and they watched them flying overhead.

6
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:42,835
Then suddenly Gilbert saw something on a rock. "That's strange," said Gilbert.

7
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:47,682
"That looks like a red swamp lizard, but I thought that species was extinct."

8
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:54,376
He carefully picked it up. "Yes, it is! I'm going to take it back to the Zoology Institute.

9
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:58,926
They will be filled with so much jealousy when they see what I have found!"

10
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:08,885
"Are you sure we should take it from its home?" asked Eliza. "Nonsense, many animals migrate. They're used to changes," said Gilbert.

11
00:01:08,885 --> 00:01:14,985
"Hmm, I don't agree with the principle of it," said Eliza. "It isn't ethical."

12
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:19,668
But Gilbert was decisive and took the lizard back to the hotel in the city.

13
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:24,911
He thought that this find would make him a highly esteemed celebrity at the Zoology Institute.

14
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:30,846
For the next few days, Gilbert fed and nurtured the lizard. But the lizard wasn't happy.

15
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:38,958
It lost its beautiful red color and began to look ordinary. In fact, Gilbert started to wonder whether it was special at all.

16
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:42,684
He went outside and found a common lizard on a piece of concrete.

17
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:48,323
When he compared them, they looked exactly alike. The lizard was only red in the swamp!

18
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:57,820
Gilbert said to Eliza, "I'm going to return this lizard to the swamp. I've learned an important lesson. Home is where we are happiest.

19
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:09,064
At home, we are special like the red lizard. We can never be so happy when we are away." "Good," said Eliza. "So, can we go home now?"
