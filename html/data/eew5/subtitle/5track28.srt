Thucydides and the Plague of Athens

2
00:00:06,142 --> 00:00:10,114
Thucydides was the world's first historian.

3
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:15,153
Presently, we get most of our knowledge about ancient Greece from his writing.

4
00:00:15,153 --> 00:00:19,897
But Thucydides didn't just write about history, he lived through it.

5
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:25,929
However, he almost didn't survive one historical event: the Plague of Athens.

6
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:32,366
In 430 BCE, an army attacked the city of Athens, where Thucydides lived.

7
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:36,853
Thousands of people hid from the army behind Athens' large walls.

8
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:40,770
The city became very crowded as the population expanded.

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,882
Then, a horrifying disease broke out. People summoned doctors.

10
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:50,939
But it was to no avail because no one understood how the disease spread.

11
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,665
It seemed random. They didn't know that it was an organism.

12
00:00:55,665 --> 00:01:00,244
Instead, they defined disease as a punishment from their gods.

13
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:07,324
Thucydides was incredulous that the gods caused the plague, but he explained why others believed it.

14
00:01:07,324 --> 00:01:11,590
There was an old, long verse which predicted the disease.

15
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,813
To paraphrase it, the verse said the gods would send a disease during a war.

16
00:01:16,813 --> 00:01:23,194
As a result, large crowds gathered at shrines to ask the gods to stop the plague.

17
00:01:23,194 --> 00:01:30,182
But the situation only worsened because these people were so close to each other they became sick.

18
00:01:30,182 --> 00:01:37,464
That's how they learned a fundamental lesson about the plague: it spread from person to person.

19
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:43,993
People wanted to leave the crowded city, but they dreaded what the army outside would do to them.

20
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:52,139
At this time, Thucydides got sick, too. He quickly scribbled down notes because he thought he would soon die.

21
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:58,704
His writing shows the stark contrast between people's behavior before and during the plague.

22
00:01:58,704 --> 00:02:05,527
There were riots, and people ignored laws. They didn't think they'd live long enough to be punished.

23
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:11,651
Many sick people were left to die in solitude because no one wanted to be near them.

24
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:16,984
The plague lingered for two years. But luckily, Thucydides survived.

25
00:02:16,984 --> 00:02:24,431
Without his writing, we would know much less about ancient Greece and the Plague of Athens.
