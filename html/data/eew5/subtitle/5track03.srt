The Young Man and the Old Man

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,356
A proud young man was looking for a new pastime.

3
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:14,649
He heard about people hiking in the national parks and decided to try it for himself.

4
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:18,933
As he started his stroll, an old man walked up to him.

5
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:22,210
"Don't go this way," the old man said.

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,030
"Beware. The paths are not clear. It's easy to get lost."

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:33,204
But the young man disagreed with the old man and bragged that he had a perfect understanding of the park.

8
00:00:33,204 --> 00:00:36,544
"I've studied maps of this area," he told him.

9
00:00:36,544 --> 00:00:41,332
"I believe I have a thorough knowledge of these trails. I won't get lost."

10
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:46,341
The old man listened to the young man and then admonished him for his pride.

11
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:50,122
"I have walked these trails my entire life," he said.

12
00:00:50,122 --> 00:00:53,430
"If you think you will be safe, then go ahead."

13
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,399
The young man ignored the old man and started along the trail.

14
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:04,046
Whenever he had to choose between an easy or difficult route, he always chose the more difficult option.

15
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:08,457
In addition, he was not conscious of which direction he was going.

16
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:11,544
After a while, he decided to return home.

17
00:01:11,544 --> 00:01:17,687
Because his course through the wilderness was so indirect, he had no idea where he was.

18
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:21,531
He looked at his map but could not pinpoint his location.

19
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:26,162
He walked one path after another but soon realized he was lost.

20
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:31,769
The sun was going down, and sudden strong winds gave a hint that it might rain.

21
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:34,289
Immense clouds filled the sky.

22
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:38,227
Awesome sounds of thunder were audible from all directions.

23
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:40,401
They echoed off the mountains.

24
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:44,024
The thought of the eventual storm tormented the young man.

25
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:48,371
He hurried in one direction but soon switched out of confusion.

26
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:51,490
Luckily, the path led him out of the park.

27
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,869
When he arrived home, he knew that he had acted like an idiot.

28
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:58,484
He realized he was lucky to be alive.

29
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:02,989
He decided to listen to people with more experience than himself.
