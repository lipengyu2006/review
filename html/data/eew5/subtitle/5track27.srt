A Dying Forest

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:09,111
Rainforests provide much of the world's oxygen supply.

3
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:15,096
But the forests' exotic trees and animals are being destroyed to make room for farms and roads.

4
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:18,820
People have been trying to conserve rainforests for years.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:25,104
But another type of forest -- the cloud forest -- is just as important and beneficial to humans.

6
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:30,890
Cloud forests are also in danger of disappearing, but little is being done to save them.

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,144
These forests are located at the tops of mountains, generally near the equator.

8
00:00:36,144 --> 00:00:41,963
These humid, wooded mountaintops are mainly in African and Central and South American countries.

9
00:00:41,963 --> 00:00:48,314
They are called "cloud forests" because their height allows for the formation of clouds among the trees.

10
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:54,964
Rainforests produce large amounts of oxygen. Cloud forests produce comparative amounts of water.

11
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:58,588
The trees in these forests pull water out of the clouds.

12
00:00:58,588 --> 00:01:04,274
The moisture gathers on the leaves. When it drips, it is deposited into streams.

13
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:10,026
The streams flow into towns at the bottom of the mountain. Then, the water is distributed to people.

14
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:19,935
The yearly cumulative rainfall in these areas is 173 to 198 centimeters. Cloud forests can pull in up to 60 percent of that.

15
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:25,255
This water is crucial to the plants and the people in the area. It helps them survive.

16
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:31,207
Cloud forests are also the birthplace of countless species of plants that can't be found anywhere else.

17
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:37,093
One small cloud forest has the capacity for as many types of plants as there are in all of Europe.

18
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:42,114
There are so many, in fact, that scientists haven't made a comprehensive list of them yet.

19
00:01:42,114 --> 00:01:50,127
These forests are being destroyed with increasing frequency. Trees are being cut down, and roads are being built in their place.

20
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:54,383
Some people have an objective to get federal money to protect the forests.

21
00:01:54,383 --> 00:01:59,836
But they have had little success. Another strategy is to replace the destroyed plants.

22
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:03,727
That, too, has been difficult because the plants are so unique.

23
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:10,011
There's plenty of work to be done, but saving the cloud forests is still a possibility.
