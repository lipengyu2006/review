The Magic Computer

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,908
I had a difficult geography project to finish by the end of the semester.

3
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:14,624
My teacher wanted it to be typewritten, so I went to the school computer room.

4
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:18,075
But when I got there, all the computers were turned off.

5
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:22,886
Apparently, there was a recent problem, and technicians were fixing it.

6
00:00:22,886 --> 00:00:26,273
I knew of some private study rooms downstairs.

7
00:00:26,273 --> 00:00:31,654
They were small and dark, and the computers were very old, but I had no choice.

8
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:34,630
At least the computers were operating correctly.

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,803
I typed and highlighted the assignment's title: "Evaluate the Government's Response to Global Warming."

10
00:00:40,803 --> 00:00:43,556
But I didn't know what to write in my essay.

11
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:46,564
Finally, I decided to find a book to help me.

12
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:52,166
I went to the library, checked the book indexes, and eventually found a useful book.

13
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,636
Then, I returned to the computer.

14
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:56,440
When I looked at the screen, I saw something so weird that I nearly fainted!

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:04,353
The essay was complete! Had somebody in cyberspace written it?

16
00:01:04,353 --> 00:01:10,906
I didn't know, but I was very happy. I printed it out and handed it in. I got an "A."

17
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:14,420
After that, I used the computer for all my assignments.

18
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,535
I'd type the title, wait awhile, and the computer would do it.

19
00:01:18,535 --> 00:01:22,776
Every assignment was perfect; I never had to edit anything.

20
00:01:22,776 --> 00:01:28,569
I stopped paying attention to my teacher's lectures and spent my extra time in the gymnasium.

21
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:31,798
And my grades got better and better.

22
00:01:31,798 --> 00:01:37,749
A month later, I was walking into class when my friend said, "Are you prepared for the test?"

23
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:42,972
"What test?" I asked. "The geography test!" he replied."

24
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:47,625
I hope you studied. It's worth 70 percent of our final grade!"

25
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:52,975
I failed the test, of course, I was completely ignorant about the subject.

26
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:58,103
After that, I made a resolution never to use the magic computer again.

27
00:01:58,103 --> 00:02:03,864
The moral of this story is that if you cheat at school, you won't learn anything.
