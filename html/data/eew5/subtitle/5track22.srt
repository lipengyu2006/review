The Scribe's Warning

2
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:15,348
A great and powerful empire needed the wood from its western areas to build palaces and homes for the emperor and his friends.

3
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:23,447
However, the empire had depleted many of its forests. The trees were important to the western areas' economy.

4
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:32,656
With no trees to sell, the commerce in that area was reduced. Citizens could no longer purchase the goods that they needed to survive.

5
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:43,270
Their life became difficult. A poor scribe from the area wanted to help. He hitchhiked to the capital to ask the emperor for charity.

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:54,291
He was invited to the palace. It was large and cozy. Tables were loaded with food, and fires burned warmly in every fireplace.

7
00:00:54,291 --> 00:01:03,721
The emperor sat upon his throne, and the scribe stood in front of him. "I've come to ask for help," the scribe said.

8
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:12,671
"We're all very poor and hungry. You've used up all of the forests, and now we have nothing to sell."

9
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:23,766
Then he added a warning. "If we don't receive help, I'm afraid that the entire empire will suffer. We must establish some unity."

10
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:29,313
Upon hearing the scribe's request, the emperor's bad temper surfaced.

11
00:01:29,313 --> 00:01:35,674
He mocked the scribe. "You think I should help," he said and laughed.

12
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:43,034
"You should just be happy to belong to this great empire. You will get nothing from me."

13
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:47,842
The emperor felt no pity for the citizens of the western area.

14
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:52,945
They were condemned to starve, The scribe returned home with nothing.

15
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:59,898
Not long after, an enemy invaded the empire from the west. They were marching to the capital.

16
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:05,150
Because the citizens felt persecuted by the emperor, they remained neutral.

17
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:12,805
They didn't fight the invaders but allowed them to march freely to the capital. The emperor was defeated.

18
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:18,648
If he had heeded the words of the scribe, then the citizens might have been the victors.

19
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:25,120
But because he had treated them badly, they treated him badly in return.
