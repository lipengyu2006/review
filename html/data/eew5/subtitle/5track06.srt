Dian & Digit

2
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:12,205
According to animal classification, gorillas are among human beings' closest living relatives.

3
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:15,730
Like us, they are intelligent, social creatures.

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:22,135
Yet movies such as King Kong aroused people's darkest fears about these misunderstood animals.

5
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:29,450
Dian Fossey changed all this by gathering empirical information that proved that they were gentle beings.

6
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,908
Fossey first became interested in gorillas on a trip she took to an African jungle.

7
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:43,171
She did not want to study gorillas while they were in the custody of zoos but hoped instead to explore how they lived in nature.

8
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:50,600
To do this, she tolerated the exclusion of her friends and family and set off to live in a mountain forest,

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,839
knowing that the gorillas frequently flocked to the hills of the Congo and Rwanda to graze on native plants.

10
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,615
And then she waited. Fossey soon discovered the gorillas.

11
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:08,111
She tried to watch them as they would congregate, but they dispersed when they saw her.

12
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:14,175
However over time, these fascinating creatures became accustomed to her presence.

13
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:19,368
They soon began to treat Fossey simply like another member of the family.

14
00:01:19,368 --> 00:01:26,835
Fossey's favorite was a baby named Digit, whom she nursed in 1967 when he injured his hand.

15
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:31,572
For a time, Digit clung to her as if she were his mother.

16
00:01:31,572 --> 00:01:36,576
He grew up to be a strong alpha male, the king of his gorilla troop.

17
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:41,238
Fossey believed that Digit was able to comprehend her love for him.

18
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:46,506
When he was killed by hunters in 1977, her heart was broken.

19
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:52,305
Fossey knew that gorillas were dying very quickly and might eventually become extinct.

20
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:56,740
So she used her articulate voice to tell Digit's story to the world.

21
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,136
Soon, every country was buzzing about his terrible end.

22
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:04,510
Fossey created the Digit Fund in his memory.

23
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,262
Gorilla hunters never lived in compliance with the laws.

24
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:13,644
Fossey herself was killed in 1985 and was buried next to Digit.

25
00:02:13,644 --> 00:02:22,438
Scientists and park rangers still clash with hunters, but thanks to the efforts of Fossey, gorillas still live free in the wild.

26
00:02:22,438 --> 00:02:28,616
Her short life embodied great courage, curiosity, and integrity.
