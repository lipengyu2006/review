Isaac's First Plane Trip

2
00:00:05,076 --> 00:00:11,650
Isaac's family was going on vacation. He was excited about the trip except for one thing.

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:19,460
He had never been on a plane before. He was scared that the plane would have a breakdown, Isaac got onto the plane.

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,512
He walked down the aisle until he found his seat. He sat down and connected the ends of his seat belt.

5
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:30,784
After being idle for a few minutes, the pilot announced that they were ready to leave.

6
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:36,056
He looked out the window at the vivid colors of the sky. He began to feel scared.

7
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:44,126
The girl sitting next to him said, "Hi, I'm Rachel! You look nervous, but you don't need to be. Flying is fun!"

8
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:49,203
"I'm still a bit nervous," Issac said, "and I'm getting hungry."

9
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:55,385
"The food service will begin soon. Just lower the tray on the seat in front of you, and flip this switch.

10
00:00:55,385 --> 00:01:02,837
Then they'll bring your dinner! Last time, they served chicken, peas, and a box of raisins," Rachel explained.

11
00:01:02,837 --> 00:01:07,556
Then the pilot notified the passengers of bad conditions in the atmosphere.

12
00:01:07,556 --> 00:01:14,650
"We're tracking the weather: lightning, clouds, etc. The ride might get a bit rough," he stated.

13
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:20,572
Suddenly, the plane started to shake. Isaac was badly afflicted by his fear.

14
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:27,504
His stomach hurt, and he thought he might vomit. He couldn't believe that he was in such an unfortunate place.

15
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:34,403
Finally, the shaking stopped. Isaac was still scared, but he tried to retain a good attitude.

16
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:39,544
"The first time I flew, the plane shook so bad that cargo started falling.

17
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:46,085
My parents told me to listen to music and read a chapter in my book. It calmed me," Rachel said.

18
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:51,845
Suddenly, the plane shook again. This time, Isaac followed Rachel's advice.

19
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:58,711
He put on headphones and took out a book by his favorite author. The book and the music helped Isaac feel better.

20
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:07,367
After a while, he didn't even notice the bad weather. The unfortunate situation didn't feel so bad after someone helped him.
