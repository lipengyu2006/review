The Knight's Plan

2
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:18,505
A town was fighting for their independence from another country.
Several rebels started a revolution.
However, they were afraid of an invasion from a lot of troops.

3
00:00:18,505 --> 00:00:24,455
They didn't have enough warriors to stop the enemy, so they asked a knight for help.

4
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:35,427
The knight made a plan.
A tall mountain was outside the town.
The road near the top was very narrow.
Cliffs rose on both sides of it.

5
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:47,491
"We must trick the enemy. They have to follow us up the mountain," the knight explained.
"On the narrow path, only a few can attack us at one time."

6
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:55,406
The people agreed with the knight's plan.
The knight put on his armor, and the warriors got their spears.

7
00:00:55,406 --> 00:01:07,279
When the enemy attacked, the knight and warriors acted as if they were afraid.
They quickly withdrew toward the mountain.
The enemy troops followed them up the steep path.

8
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:18,578
Soon, the enemy became tired.
At the summit, the knight and his troops stopped.
The enemy was close behind them.
But now they were tired.

9
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:29,359
Also, only a few could attack because the path was narrow.
The knight and the warriors fought the enemy.
But there were too many troops.

10
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:36,892
The knight was afraid.
If the warriors yielded the path to the enemy, the town would be lost.

11
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:50,430
A storm suddenly came over the mountain.
There was strong wind and rain.
Thunder boomed.
Lightning struck some trees near the enemy.
The trees blazed.

12
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:59,328
The flames scared the enemy, and they retreated.
They ran down the mountain, out of the town, and never returned.

13
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:06,588
The knight explained, "With a little luck, a good plan beats even a big army."
