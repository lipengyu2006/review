00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,338
The Real Saint Nick

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:11,298
At Christmas, children wait for Saint Nicholas to bring gifts down the chimney.

3
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:16,014
But it's not just a story.
Saint Nicholas was a real person.

4
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:21,766
A long time ago, a man named Marcus occupied a house with his family.

5
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:23,788
He was not modest.

6
00:00:23,788 --> 00:00:28,970
He always told everybody he was the strongest man in the province.

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,375
He worked hard, but he could barely sustain his family.

8
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,537
He wanted to save money and prosper.

9
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:40,631
Still, he could never earn a penny more than he needed.

10
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:44,777
One day, Marcus made an agreement with a blacksmith.

11
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:50,322
The blacksmith had a lot of work to do,
but he couldn't do it all by himself.

12
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:53,535
Marcus wanted to help him forge iron.

13
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:57,837
The blacksmith agreed to compensate him with a lot of money.

14
00:00:57,837 --> 00:01:01,464
In the same town, there was a man named Nicholas.

15
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:05,196
At an early age, Nicholas started preaching.

16
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:09,290
But he also believed that he should be humble and helpful.

17
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,887
He learned that helping people gave him even more satisfaction than preaching.

18
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:18,100
One day, Nicholas encountered Marcus.

19
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,194
Marcus told Nicholas about his agreement with the blacksmith.

20
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:31,160
"I worked hard for him," Marcus said,
"but a problem arose. Even though I worked for him, he didn't pay me."

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,535
Nicholas wanted to help Marcus.
That night, he went back to Marcus's house.

22
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:39,556
He brought a bag of gold.

23
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:42,458
It exceeded the amount that Marcus needed.

24
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:47,381
Nicholas climbed up a ladder and dropped the bag of gold down the chimney.

25
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:49,973
Marcus thanked his benefactor.

26
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:53,859
Soon, people found out about Nicholas's gift.

27
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:56,451
He became well known and loved.

28
00:01:56,451 --> 00:02:04,224
Even today, people still give secret gifts to children.
And we say they are from Saint Nicholas.
