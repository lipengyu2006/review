The Magic Pear Tree

2
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:17,003
It was a cool morning, and the grass was covered in mist.
The market was full of people.
A mean farmer named Jack yelled, "Pears for sale!"

3
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:27,823
He sat on a bench, plotting how he could trick people.
Then, an orphan came to his cart.
"Can you spare a pear?" she asked.

4
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:39,158
Jack felt rage.
He replied, "You don't have any money!"
"Please, I haven't had supper in days."
"No!" shouted the farmer.

5
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:49,514
The orphan sighed.
However, a pregnant lady heard the dispute and came over to Jack.
"Just give her a pear," she said.

6
00:00:49,514 --> 00:01:02,704
Jack had no shame and said no.
Finally, a man bought a pear for the girl.
The girl quickly ate it, but she saved the seed.
She wanted to get revenge.

7
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:11,102
She told Jack, "I know a way to get hundreds of pears in one day.
I'll show you how."

8
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:18,573
He watched the girl dig a hole.
She dropped the seed into the ground.
Then she spread the dirt over it.

9
00:01:18,573 --> 00:01:27,641
"Watch closely," she said.
"In a few minutes, a stem will grow.
It'll turn into a tree that's full of pears!"

10
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:38,719
Jack stared at the dirt, but nothing happened.
The only objects there were a few daisies.
He looked for the girl, but she had snuck away.

11
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:47,581
Then, he looked at his cart in horror.
It was empty!
He suddenly realized that the orphan had tricked him.

12
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:53,764
While Jack was waiting for the tree to grow, the people had taken the pears from his cart.

13
00:01:53,764 --> 00:02:03,296
They all laughed while they were eating the tender fruit.
The farmer felt ashamed.
The incident taught him to be kinder.
