An Interesting Life

2
00:00:05,622 --> 00:00:09,760
A man looked through some boxes with his grandson.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,337
They were filled with old photographs and objects that portrayed important events from the grandfather's life.

4
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:21,959
He wished to share the circumstances behind each event with his grandson.

5
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:27,370
The grandson, however, thought his grandfather's stories were boring.

6
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:33,257
The grandfather coped with this.
He ignored his grandson's criticism.

7
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:43,494
He took a photo from the box.
"That's the submarine I was on during the war," he explained.
The grandson gazed at it.

8
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:53,996
The grandfather glanced at the next picture and frowned.
It showed a row of coffins.
His grandson noticed the grief in his grandfather's face.

9
00:00:53,996 --> 00:01:05,613
"What is it?" the boy inquired.
"This was after a nuclear bomb was dropped," the grandfather answered.
"It devastated a city."

10
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:12,667
Next, the grandfather pulled a toy microscope from the box and rotated it in his hand.

11
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:22,427
"Where did you get that?" the grandson asked.
"This is a souvenir I bought at the science museum," the grandfather said.

12
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:34,573
Now, the boy was really interested.
He started to understand that his grandfather was telling him a larger story.
It was the story of his grandfather's life.

13
00:01:34,573 --> 00:01:40,567
The grandfather picked up another photo.
It showed a young bride and groom.

14
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:50,380
They were very happy.
A certificate was attached to the photo.
The boy couldn't read it, but he traced his finger over the paper.

15
00:01:50,380 --> 00:02:00,511
"What's this from, Granddad?" he asked.
"That's my marriage license from the day I married your grandmother," the grandfather said.

16
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:07,141
"Wow!" said the boy.
"Granddad, now I know all about your life!"
