The Great Pyramids Of Egypt

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:13,859
The distinct history of the famous Great Pyramids has been studied for many years by people who study archaeology.

3
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:18,075
The pyramids were built nearly 5,000 years ago!

4
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:24,485
According to ancient Egyptians, kings played an important role in the building of the pyramids.

5
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:34,417
Egyptians believed that kings were chosen by the gods and that,
when a king died, he went on to become the god of the dead in the afterlife.

6
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:42,386
Gold, food, and clothes were buried with the body so that the spirit would have these things in the afterlife.

7
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:48,219
The royal family and other elite individuals were also buried near the king.

8
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:55,380
Pyramids were founded for the sole reason of helping the king by containing his things for the afterlife.

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,230
The biggest of the three pyramids is known as the Great Pyramid.

10
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,984
This structure took over twenty years to engineer.

11
00:01:03,984 --> 00:01:09,528
The Great Pyramid is made of over 2.5 million stone blocks;

12
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:13,512
the base alone covers an area of thirteen acres.

13
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:17,439
(One acre is almost the size of a football field.)

14
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,445
The visible core of the Great Pyramid was originally covered by smooth casing stones.

15
00:01:23,445 --> 00:01:28,931
Some of the casing stones that cover the surface can still be seen at the base.

16
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:33,781
The stones were laid so well that there is not a single gap between them.

17
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:43,656
The interior of the Great Pyramid is accessible through stairs that lead to a channel,
which then divides into a corridor going up and another going down.

18
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:50,066
The rising corridor goes up to the Queen's Chamber, the Grand Gallery, and the King's Chamber.

19
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:55,263
The other corridor goes down to an underground chamber and an escape tunnel.

20
00:01:55,263 --> 00:02:02,078
The Sphinx is a big statue of a lion with a human head and can be found near the Great Pyramid.

21
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,679
The statue is also made from big stones, and it is said to guard the pyramid.

22
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:18,709
Surrounded by history and mystery,
the Great Pyramids of Egypt are a popular place to visit,
and tourists come from around the world to see their glory.
