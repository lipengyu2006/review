00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,468
Sheriff Dan

2
00:00:05,468 --> 00:00:14,097
Dan was the evil sheriff of Oceantown.
Dan was as cruel as the devil.
He worshiped money.

3
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:19,264
Dan was a millionaire, but he paid his police officers almost nothing.

4
00:00:19,264 --> 00:00:25,986
The police were very bitter, but Dan didn't care.
He only cared about his money.

5
00:00:25,986 --> 00:00:32,909
Every person who inhabited Oceantown disliked him.
Dan enforced cruel laws.

6
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:39,180
Once, Dan even put his own brother in jail for throwing a coin into a fountain!

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,247
Sometimes, he pointed his gun into the air and pulled the trigger.

8
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:51,521
He didn't want the bullets to hit anyone.
He just wanted to scare people with the loud sound.

9
00:00:51,521 --> 00:01:00,501
Finally, the people of Oceantown decided that they had to get rid of Sheriff Dan,
and tried to find some way to do this.

10
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:05,116
Their wish to get rid of Dan helped to unify the town.

11
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:11,387
They marched to Dan's house.
He was startled by the sight when he ran to the door.

12
00:01:11,387 --> 00:01:18,260
When he opened the door, the crowd jumped on him.
They used a rope to tie him to a chair.

13
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:24,982
Dan yelled, "Get your hands off me!
I'll put you all in jail for the rest of your lives!"

14
00:01:24,982 --> 00:01:31,504
The crowd didn't listen.
They carried Dan to the harbor and put him aboard a vessel.

15
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:39,882
Dan was so scared that he began to sweat.
He begged, "If you let me go, I will give you all my money!"

16
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:50,919
The crowd said, "Sheriff, we don't care about your money.
We know you will never change.
We're sending you on a voyage to the middle of the ocean."

17
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:55,684
The boat drifted out of the port, and Dan was never seen again.

18
00:01:55,684 --> 00:02:00,199
The people chose a new sheriff, who was kind and fair.
