00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,254
The Circus

2
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:13,599
Ben was unhappy.
He lived on a ranch near a small town,
and he didn't have many friends.

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,811
Then one day, a messenger came to the ranch.
He showed the headline in the town newspaper.

4
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:26,993
The circus was coming to the town.
It even coincided with Ben's birthday!

5
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:32,195
Ben was very excited as his father steered the car through the town.

6
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:38,995
The circus couldn't accommodate all the people who wanted to see the show, but Ben had a ticket.

7
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:46,361
Ben peered at the activity around him.
He watched people of both genders dance all around.

8
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:52,182
They wore funny costumes, and their hair was dyed many different colors.

9
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:57,282
Also, tame tigers with stripes on their fur did tricks.

10
00:00:57,282 --> 00:01:01,815
Outside, people could commission an informal portrait.

11
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:07,018
They posed in front of a funny picture while an artist quickly drew them.

12
00:01:07,018 --> 00:01:16,290
Ben couldn't believe it.
He was happier than he had ever been before.
That day, Ben knew what he wanted to do.

13
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,987
He loved the circus to such an extent that he wanted to have his own circus when he grew older.

14
00:01:22,987 --> 00:01:30,044
Seeing the circus was like a dose of medicine for him.
He wasn't unhappy anymore.

15
00:01:30,044 --> 00:01:36,432
He felt special.
He inquired about what he needed to do to have his own circus.

16
00:01:36,432 --> 00:01:47,919
He studied hard and learned about business.
Ben worked very hard, and one day, he had his own circus.
It was a great circus.

17
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:53,792
People told him that he could be very rich.
But he wasn't tempted by money.

18
00:01:53,792 --> 00:02:03,424
He just wanted to make children happy.
He knew the circus had changed his life,
and he wanted to do the same thing for others.
