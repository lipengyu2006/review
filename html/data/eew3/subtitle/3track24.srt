Travel Writers

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:15,583
Travel writers travel around the world and write about their experiences.
They post their articles on an online blog or in a magazine.

3
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:22,291
It may seem like the perfect way to earn income,
but there is a lot of hard work involved.

4
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:26,728
Travel writers have to be prepared to travel on short notice.

5
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:37,667
Whether getting on a jet to travel abroad or boarding a small plane for a domestic flight,
travel writers must have official documents such as passports.

6
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:45,613
They must also have international currency.
And they must have personal belongings ready at all times.

7
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:54,798
Since travel writers also get paid to write about their trips,
a laptop to keep track of all the data they gather is important.

8
00:00:54,798 --> 00:01:03,002
Being good at research is a must for travel writers.
They must choose airlines that offer maximum travel perks.

9
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:10,278
They must hunt for hotel bargains.
And they must choose the best things to do on a brief trip.

10
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:22,971
Good travel writers must attract an audience in large volumes.
To do this, they first write drafts about their experiences.
They edit the drafts many times.

11
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:35,148
Since they get paid to recommend and refer travelers to hotels, restaurants, and places to visit,
their articles have to be well written and inviting to read.

12
00:01:35,148 --> 00:01:46,603
Getting paid to travel around the world might seem like an exciting profession,
but travel writers often endure sleepless nights and long wait times at the airport.

13
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:52,021
They travel to remote locations and must adjust to new environments.

14
00:01:52,021 --> 00:02:03,631
It takes some time to make these adjustments,
but for someone who loves to travel as a hobby and loves to write,
being a travel writer is a great job!
