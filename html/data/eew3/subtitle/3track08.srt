00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,711
The Anniversary Gift

2
00:00:05,711 --> 00:00:10,804
Joe was a carpenter.
He built houses in the highlands.

3
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:16,926
Joe's wife, Stella, used a needle and thread to sew elegant clothing.

4
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:20,682
She only used beautiful fabric to make clothes.

5
00:00:20,682 --> 00:00:25,518
Since they didn't have a lot of money, they lived in an old shed.

6
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:31,383
Water dripped in when it rained.
They had broken chairs instead of a couch.

7
00:00:31,383 --> 00:00:35,808
But they had coal for heat, and flour from the mill for bread.

8
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:40,181
Together, they trimmed the bushes to make their house look nice.

9
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:45,429
Joe and Stella were poor, but not ashamed. They were happy.

10
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:49,442
Sometimes in the evening, they walked downtown.

11
00:00:49,442 --> 00:00:52,426
They looked in store windows and dreamed.

12
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:55,924
Stella wanted a hairbrush with an ivory handle.

13
00:00:55,924 --> 00:01:02,664
She pulled her hair upwards every day because she didn't have a brush to make it nice.

14
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:06,214
Joe wanted to fix his grandfather's watch.

15
00:01:06,214 --> 00:01:11,461
For their anniversary, Stella wanted to get Joe what he wanted.

16
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:13,828
But then she did the arithmetic.

17
00:01:13,828 --> 00:01:18,150
It would take at least six months to save enough money.

18
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,169
Then, she had an idea.
She cut off all of her hair and sold it.

19
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:28,851
Meanwhile, Joe knew that he could never fix his watch.

20
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:34,253
So he polished it and sold it.
He made enough to buy the brush.

21
00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:38,369
On their anniversary, the door burst open.

22
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,919
Joe was excited to give Stella his gift.

23
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:46,292
But first, Stella gave him the money to fix the watch.

24
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:50,356
When he saw his wife without any hair, he smiled.

25
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:57,250
"I sold my watch to buy you something," Joe said.
He gave her the brush, and she laughed.

26
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:03,424
They were both willing to give up something very special to make each other happy.
