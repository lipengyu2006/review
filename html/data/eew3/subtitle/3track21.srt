Genes and Cancer

2
00:00:05,722 --> 00:00:12,230
Cancer is a disease that develops because of unusual cell growth in the human body.

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:19,747
Cancer cells take over and attack healthy cells,
leaving the normal working cells in a state of destruction.

4
00:00:19,747 --> 00:00:25,862
Extensive research has been done to understand the link between genes and cancer.

5
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:34,894
A gene is what decides the traits a living thing may inherit.
Genes can be found in the DNA of each cell in the body.

6
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:41,794
DNA contains a code that carries all the needed information about the qualities of a living thing.

7
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:47,741
Genes control how cells work by making proteins that have special jobs.

8
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:56,100
These proteins make up everything â€“ bones, teeth, muscles, blood, etc. - in our bodies.

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,617
Genes pass on the DNA code to proteins that decide eye color, hair color, and skin color.

10
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:08,834
Furthermore, damaged DNA can sometimes be passed on as well.

11
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:16,183
The damaged DNA can eventually lead to gene changes, which then may result in a problem in the body.

12
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:23,925
Over time, the problem may become a disease and, sometimes, even become cancerous.

13
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:36,043
There are many different types of cancers.
Breast cancer is the most common in the female population,
while prostate cancer is most common in the male population.

14
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:46,085
Drinking alcohol increases the chances of developing cancer in different places of the body such as the head, neck, liver, or throat.

15
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:51,526
Cigarette smoking is the number one cause of lung cancer in the United States.

16
00:01:51,526 --> 00:01:59,941
Studies also show a strong link between eating too much sugar and a higher risk of cancerous cells growing even faster.

17
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:06,505
Although scientists have been studying cancer,
there is still no cure for the disease.

18
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:14,752
Hopefully, a cure will eventually be found and prevent the sadness that comes from losing a loved one to cancer.
