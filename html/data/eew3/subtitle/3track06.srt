The Senator and the Worm

2
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:12,632
A rich senator lived in a big house.
He had more money than anyone in his district.

3
00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:17,461
One day, he was sitting on a chair listening to a radio broadcast.

4
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:24,938
As he listened to the news bulletin,
a worm crawled from underneath the chair and onto his head.

5
00:00:24,938 --> 00:00:29,025
His cook was in the kitchen stirring some spaghetti sauce.

6
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:33,158
Suddenly, a cry from the senator alerted him.

7
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:37,570
He ran to the rear of the house where the senator was sitting.

8
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,957
The cook looked and saw the worm.
He tried to console the senator.

9
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:50,991
"I'll take it off right away," he said.
"No!" shouted the senator. "I want you to kill it."

10
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:58,746
"But it's only a worm," the cook said.
"Why should we execute it? It hasn't committed a crime."

11
00:00:58,746 --> 00:01:04,691
The senator could not endure the worm on his head. "Hurry!" he shouted.

12
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:12,214
The cook looked through several drawers but found nothing.
Then he ran to the closet and took out a pipe.

13
00:01:12,214 --> 00:01:16,951
He returned to the senator and lifted the pipe over his head.

14
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:24,799
He knew he couldn't just tap the worm.
He was going to hit it hard.
He grasped the pipe tightly.

15
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,258
"What are you waiting for?" said the senator. "Kill it!"

16
00:01:29,258 --> 00:01:32,648
The cook swung the pipe at the senator's head.

17
00:01:32,648 --> 00:01:37,710
"Oh, no," the worm said.
"He's going to chop me in half."

18
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,496
It jumped off the senator's head.

19
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:43,097
There was a tremendous noise.

20
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:52,199
"Owww!" cried the senator.
A bump rose upon his skull.
Meanwhile, the worm crawled outside.

21
00:01:52,199 --> 00:02:02,601
"That was close," said the worm,
"Instead of being nice, he wanted to hurt me.
Now, that man has a big bump on his head."
