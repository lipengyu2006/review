00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:16,121
Dear Diary, I am beyond excited!
My cousin Ella is coming all the way from England for a visit.

3
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:27,353
We haven't seen each other for many years.
Ella's plane will land soon,
and I want to be a gracious host and get everything ready to welcome my special guest from abroad.

4
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:36,801
The warm temperature in July is just right.
Earlier today, I opened the window to let in fresh air and looked outside.

5
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:45,391
The afternoon sky was a brilliant blue,
the grass was a fresh emerald green,
and the pink roses were in full bloom.

6
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:52,130
It was a stunning display of natural beauty.
Ella is coming at the perfect time!

7
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,623
I still have to finish cleaning up and then vacuum the carpet.

8
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:01,314
I have already stocked the refrigerator with Ella's favorite foods.

9
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:07,062
Last night, I set out clean towels and arranged the guest bedroom for Ella.

10
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:11,092
I will set out toiletries and other things soon.

11
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:16,444
I want to go over the activity list for Ella's visit one last time.

12
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:22,522
I made sure to keep a copy of the list on my desk and also on my computer.

13
00:01:22,522 --> 00:01:30,781
I meticulously planned the details for each day so that they are productive and packed with fun-filled activities,

14
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:40,560
I know that Ella loves history,
so we will visit the museum on Monday,
where there is a special show about architecture in modern cities.

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,299
We will go to the art gallery on Tuesday and see the latest works of contemporary art.

16
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:54,434
I also want to take Ella to the upper part of town because that is where the best shopping and sales are.

17
00:01:54,434 --> 00:02:01,240
Then, we'll watch Hamlet, a Shakespearean play being performed at the local drama theater.

18
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,120
I also want to take Ella on a canoe ride and enjoy the many lakes around the city.

19
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,661
We can pack a picnic basket, have lunch at the lake, and enjoy the beautiful weather outside.

20
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:18,616
I am really excited about it because I've never been on a canoe ride!

21
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:28,989
There are so many sightseeing opportunities and so much to show Ella,
but I also want to spend time at home with Ella so we can both relax and catch up.

22
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:33,812
I'd better run because it's almost time to pick up Ella at the airport.

23
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:36,191
I can't wait to see Ella!

24
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:38,900
love, Gemma
