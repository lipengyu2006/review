Patsy Ann

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:11,592
A long time ago in Alaska, a dog named Patsy Ann watched the horizon.

3
00:00:11,592 --> 00:00:16,883
Every day, she waited by the bay for ships returning from an expedition.

4
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:25,493
Patsy Ann was a brilliant dog, and she was very unique.
She was deaf. She couldn't bark, either.

5
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:30,543
But she used all of her other senses to know when a ship was near.

6
00:00:30,543 --> 00:00:38,672
Patsy Ann lived on the streets.
Her owners did not want her because she could not hear, so they abandoned her.

7
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,895
She found refuge in a fancy hotel.

8
00:00:41,895 --> 00:00:50,264
Guests rubbed her back and scratched her chin.
Many people gave her food.
She became quite overweight.

9
00:00:50,264 --> 00:00:57,094
She became very famous.
Visitors to Alaska were enthusiastic about meeting her.

10
00:00:57,094 --> 00:01:02,818
They brought presents for her.
They liked seeing her, and the feeling was mutual.

11
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:06,762
The mayor said Patsy Ann should be called the town's greeter.

12
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:15,035
The people in town loved Patsy Ann, too, even though she lived on the streets.
They were willing to fight to keep her.

13
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:19,749
A new law made all dogs wear a collar and get shots.

14
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:25,905
The mayor received many complaints.
People wanted Patsy Ann to be able to stay.

15
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:29,176
One ambitious sailor got people to help.

16
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:33,409
Together, they paid for Patsy Ann to go to the veterinarian.

17
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:37,882
She got her shots and a collar. She could stay.

18
00:01:37,882 --> 00:01:42,452
When Patsy Ann died, everyone missed the town's loyal greeter.

19
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:46,540
So the mayor hired someone to make a statue of Patsy Ann.

20
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,185
He restored the town's greeter.

21
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:55,246
Now, she stands near the water forever, waiting for ships to come home.
