The Ice Cream Cone Explosion

2
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:10,960
One day, John walked to his uncle's ice cream shop.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:19,848
When he reached the sidewalk near the shop,
he caught the scent of ice cream cones and anticipated eating some icecream.

4
00:00:19,848 --> 00:00:25,246
Sam opened the door.
Uncle John had a new, steel machine.

5
00:00:25,246 --> 00:00:30,972
"What is that?"
"It's a cone maker.
I built it from a kit.

6
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:37,297
You take flour from the barrel and put it in this pan," Uncle John said. 

7
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:46,676
"Then, add water and sugar here and stir it so the sugar dissolves.
Next, you fasten down the beam."

8
00:00:46,676 --> 00:00:55,237
Uncle John wanted to look casual, but he was excited.
He made a few swift movements and turned it on.

9
00:00:55,237 --> 00:01:00,526
There was a puff of smoke, and then cones came out the other end.

10
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:09,305
"Is it hard to use?" Sam asked.
"On the contrary, it's easy to use. Want to try?"

11
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:16,611
Sam washed his hands with caution.
He made a deliberate attempt to keep germs out of the dough.

12
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:22,064
Soon, Sam had his first cone.
He smiled in triumph!

13
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:27,953
Uncle John tried to turn the machine off,
but it kept making cones.

14
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:33,024
Sam and Uncle John put them on the counter, then on chairs.

15
00:01:33,024 --> 00:01:37,441
Before long, cones were scattered all over the floor.

16
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:41,912
They tried everything to stop it, but it wouldn't stop!

17
00:01:41,912 --> 00:01:48,074
"What are we going to do?" he said.
"Kick it!" yelled Sam.

18
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:52,981
Uncle John lifted his foot and gave the machine a kick.

19
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:56,689
It made a funny noise and exploded.

20
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:59,579
They were both covered with dough.

21
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,396
Uncle John laughed when he knew Sam was OK.

22
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:10,539
He tossed Sam a rag to clean his face and smiled.
"I guess we have enough cones now!"
