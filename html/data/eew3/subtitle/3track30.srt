The Island

2
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:13,326
"Where am I?" Bob thought to himself when he woke up on a beach.
"I can't remember what happened."

3
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:18,773
There had been a bad storm, and Bob's fishing boat had sunk.

4
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:25,031
He washed ashore on a small island,
but he had gotten hurt during the storm.

5
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:32,041
He had a terrible headache, and he had a fracture in his shoulder.
He felt awful.

6
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:41,949
But he had a strong desire to make it home to his spouse and children.
He had to tolerate all the pain and devise a plan.

7
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:52,958
Bob stood up and looked around.
"I'll walk to a higher place so I can see everything around me and see far in the distance," thought Bob.

8
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:59,332
"Maybe I'll gain some insight about this island and find something to help me escape."

9
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:06,342
As he walked along a mountain ridge,
he noticed that the tall trees looked strong and thick.

10
00:01:06,342 --> 00:01:10,746
Bob got a brilliant idea.
He could build a raft!

11
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:13,933
He cut down some leaves and tree limbs.

12
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:24,014
Even though his shoulder injury affected his ability to carry the materials,
he slowly shoved them down the mountain until he reached the coastline.

13
00:01:24,014 --> 00:01:33,691
Bob was a proficient builder.
He used his building expertise to line up the limbs and tie them together with long vines.

14
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:43,077
When the raft was finished,
Bob was happy with his work.
"This will bring me home to my family," he said with a smile.

15
00:01:43,077 --> 00:01:51,826
At last, Bob was ready to implement his plan.
With all his might, he thrust the raft into the water.

16
00:01:51,826 --> 00:01:56,461
He climbed on and began the job of finding his way home.

17
00:01:56,461 --> 00:02:09,962
Bob smiled again and thought,
"I'm glad I kept a good attitude.
It prevented the pain from deterring me from my plan.
Optimism and ambition make anything possible."

18
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:19,174
Slowly, he floated out to sea.
In a few days, he made it to shore and ran home to see his worried family.
