Little Wolf and Mother Wolf

2
00:00:05,978 --> 00:00:16,440
Mother Wolf was a magnificent animal.
She had all the traits of a terrific hunter.
She was very strong and fast.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:28,289
She knew how to hide and how to seize animals.
Mother Wolf was the forest's supreme creature.
Her skills were evident to all the other animals.

4
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:38,964
Mother Wolf lived in a den beneath a tree with her cub, Little Wolf.
One morning at dawn, Little Wolf and Mother Wolf were eating breakfast.

5
00:00:38,964 --> 00:00:49,372
Little Wolf looked sad.
Mother Wolf said, "What is wrong, my cub?"
Little Wolf said, "I want to be big like you.

6
00:00:49,372 --> 00:01:00,741
You can run and leap better than anyone.
You can howl so loudly.
Being big is a necessity, and I am so small."

7
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:09,335
Mother Wolf said, "Don't be dissatisfied with your size.
Being small can be very helpful sometimes."

8
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:18,195
Just then, rain and hail began to fall.
The tree was hit by lightning.
It fell on the wolves' den.

9
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:24,547
Little Wolf was scared.
The wolves knew that escaping the den was vital.

10
00:01:24,547 --> 00:01:36,129
Mother Wolf said, "Little Wolf, I cannot move the heavy pile of branches.
But you can escape with ease.
You can get out and find help!"

11
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:45,897
Little Wolf crawled out of the den and called all the large animals for help.
They went to the den and pulled away the branches.

12
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:56,252
Mother Wolf came out and said, "Thank you, Little Wolf! You saved my life!"
She softly squeezed Little Wolf and kissed her.

13
00:01:56,252 --> 00:02:07,888
Little Wolf smiled.
She said, "Mother, this outcome has taught me a profound lesson.
Even though I'm small, I'm still important."
