The Boy Who Saved the Town

2
00:00:05,722 --> 00:00:13,779
Marcus lived in a small suburb near the sea.
He was a stubborn boy, and he only cared about himself.

3
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:20,502
His father worked as a chemist for a large institution and wanted Marcus to get a job there.

4
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:27,034
Instead, the boy delivered milk.
Every morning, he took dairy products to the grocers.

5
00:00:27,034 --> 00:00:35,807
One day, Marcus was jogging down the street that descended into the lower part of the town with a gallon of milk to give to a merchant.

6
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:41,767
He didn't want to be late.
He ran down a path beside a large canal.

7
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:50,540
A wall there kept water from coming into the town during high tide.
But Marcus saw a small hole in the wall.

8
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,737
Marcus knew that if the wall broke,
it would be a tragedy for the town.

9
00:00:55,737 --> 00:01:02,508
At first, he hesitated.
He had to choose between helping himself and helping the town.

10
00:01:02,508 --> 00:01:12,473
There was only one way to save the town.
It seemed crazy to him, but it was the only thing he could do.
He poked his finger into the hole.

11
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:18,242
This didn't fix the problem forever, but it did postpone the tragedy.

12
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:23,820
His finger ached.
He felt the chill of the arctic water as it splashed him.

13
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,828
There was no one else around.
He knew he had to wait until the tide went out again.

14
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:35,073
It was very difficult, but Marcus stayed there and saved the town.

15
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:39,841
Once the tide had gone out, Marcus told everyone what happened.

16
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:44,847
A group of people went to the wall.
They saw the hole and fixed it.

17
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:53,763
Everyone was very happy with Marcus.
The local congress even gave him a gift for saving the town.
He was a hero.
