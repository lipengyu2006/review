00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,343
Everyone Is Special

2
00:00:05,343 --> 00:00:11,701
When I was young, everything that went wrong in my house seemed to be my fault.

3
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:19,395
Once, my brothers tried to make cookies.
They blended flour and ginger and made a disgusting paste.

4
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:24,791
Then, they tried to wash it down the drain,
but it got all over the floor.

5
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:34,141
Later, my brothers said that I had done it, and I had to wipe it up.
I worried that my parents liked them more than me.

6
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:40,820
One autumn day, I was sure I would make my parents proud.
I bought a model rocket.

7
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:49,582
After I put it together,
I invited everybody to watch it.
I wanted my brothers to envy my technical knowledge.

8
00:00:49,582 --> 00:01:01,444
I lit the fuse, but nothing happened.
"Looks like your fireworks don't work.
I hope you kept the receipt so you can return them," my brother said.

9
00:01:01,444 --> 00:01:07,428
"It's not a firework!" I screamed.
They were making fun of me again.

10
00:01:07,428 --> 00:01:12,076
I didn't know what went wrong.
I hadn't altered anything.

11
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:19,449
I quickly moved the wires on the bottom, hoping that would help.
Suddenly, the rocket flew up.

12
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:30,296
We stood aside as it curved through the grass and ran straight into the mailbox.
Then, the mailbox collapsed.
The rocket was crushed.

13
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:38,631
Embarrassed, I ran inside and hid.
A few minutes later, my mom asked, "Are you OK?"

14
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:48,515
"I just wanted them to be jealous of me for once.
Now, I see why you and Dad don't love me as much as you love them," I said.

15
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:54,713
"That's not true!" said my mom.
"See my fingers... Each one is different.

16
00:01:54,713 --> 00:02:01,017
You kids are like my fingers: all are different,
but I love them all the same."

17
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:08,070
I embraced her.
Now, I know that my parents love me just as much as my brothers.
