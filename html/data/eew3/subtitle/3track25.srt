How Did Greenland Get Its Name?

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:14,722
The nation of Greenland isn't very green.
The sun's rays don't shine there for three whole months.

3
00:00:14,722 --> 00:00:22,191
As a result, it's covered with snow, ice, and frost.
Then, how was the name derived?

4
00:00:14,722 --> 00:00:36,483
It started with a Viking named Erik the Red.
Erik had many merits.
However, there was an underlying problem: he got angry easily.
People were scared of him.

5
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:44,919
However, he was married to the niece of a very powerful man.
So, everybody tried to be nice to him.

6
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:52,925
One day, Erik fought with his neighbor and killed him.
His consequent punishment was to leave Iceland.

7
00:00:52,925 --> 00:01:04,638
Many stories circulated about a land west of Iceland.
But only a fraction of the people in Iceland believed them.
Still, Erik wanted to find it.

8
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:15,492
Erik sailed toward the land via the Atlantic Ocean.
His marine knowledge was good, but the trip was hard.
Some of his men drowned.

9
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:22,799
Erik's lieutenant wanted to resign from his position.
Others thought about committing suicide.

10
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:32,095
Suddenly, Erik thought he saw something.
"I don't believe it," said Erik.
"It must be an illusion."

11
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:39,671
But it was no trick - it was the new land!
Erik trembled in the cold polar air.

12
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:46,817
He saw that there was ice everywhere.
He realized that the ice could keep enemies out.

13
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:54,393
Not even the best navy could invade the new land.
He could start a new dynasty in his name.

14
00:01:54,393 --> 00:02:01,593
But how could he convince people to live here?
"I'll call it Greenland," he said.

15
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:08,954
Erik's plan worked.
Within two years, over a thousand people moved to Greenland.
