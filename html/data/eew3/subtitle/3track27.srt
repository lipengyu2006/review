Pizarro and the Inca Gold

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:12,614
According to rumors, there's lots of precious gold hidden in the jungles of Peru.

3
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:26,355
It got there when the Spanish conquered parts of South America.
A Spanish noble, Francisco Pizarro, arrived in Peru in the 1500s.
He found a group of people called the Incas.

4
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:35,588
The Incas believed that their leader, Atahualpa, was both a king and a god.
But Pizarro didn't agree.

5
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:46,914
"It is a sin for a man to think he is God!" he said to Atahualpa.
Atahualpa thought Pizarro was insulting his heritage.

6
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:57,434
He thought the blonde Spanish men held prejudices against the Incas.
But Atahualpa was a kind man and didn't want to fight the Spaniards.

7
00:00:57,434 --> 00:01:04,198
He said, "If I give you a room full of gold,
will you leave my country in peace?"

8
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,780
Pizarro was suspicious.
He thought Atahualpa was exaggerating.

9
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:18,798
But a few days later,
Pizarro returned to the Inca palace with his ambassadors.
He saw a room filled with stacks of gold.

10
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:26,152
There were golden necklaces, cups, plates, and vases.
It was a great spectacle.

11
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:38,014
He acknowledged that Atahualpa had told the truth.
But after seeing the gold, he wanted all of Peru's gold.
So he didn't leave the country.

12
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:42,952
The Spanish soldiers stayed in Peru and grabbed all the gold they could find.

13
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:50,628
But the Inca people tricked the Spaniards.
They mixed the gold with tin so that it was poor quality.

14
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:56,694
They gave this gold to the Spaniards.
Meanwhile, they hid the good gold.

15
00:01:56,694 --> 00:02:01,364
They put it into sacks and dragged it deep into the jungle.

16
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:08,664
The Spanish conquerors never found the gold.
People think it is still there today.
