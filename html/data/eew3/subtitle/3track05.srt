00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,193
Trick or Treat!

2
00:00:05,193 --> 00:00:09,724
Many different cultures have had traditions about the dead.

3
00:00:09,724 --> 00:00:16,291
People in places like Ireland, China, Egypt, and Mexico believed that souls needed food.

4
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:21,178
They thought the food nourished them on their journey from cemeteries to heaven.

5
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:24,946
People had to put out good things for souls to eat.

6
00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:30,037
However, if the food rotted or spoiled, the soul got mad.

7
00:00:30,037 --> 00:00:35,280
The wicked soul might curse the family and make them starve during the winter.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,000
In other places, people begged for food on a holiday that remembers the souls of dead saints.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,277
People wore disguises with hoods that covered their faces.

10
00:00:46,277 --> 00:00:51,215
If they did not get food, they played a trick on the home's owner.

11
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:56,153
For this reason, the activity is known as "trick-or-treating."

12
00:00:56,153 --> 00:01:03,281
Shortly after people first began trick-or-treating,
parents started sending their children to beg on that day.

13
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:08,830
Housewives gave the children food if they performed a song or a dance.

14
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:15,346
When people moved to America from all over the world,
they brought this tradition with them.

15
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:20,641
Inhabitants of villages started trick-or-treating in the early 1900s.

16
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:27,310
In 1939, a children's publication acquainted the whole country with the tradition.

17
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,957
It became very popular.

18
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:35,456
Today, trick-or-treaters do not beg for food, and they are not scared of souls.

19
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:40,190
They just enjoy the thrill of dressing up like creatures and getting candy.

20
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,703
Ghosts and skeletons are favorite costumes.

21
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:48,539
But some children wear fancy disguises, like pirate costumes.

22
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:52,001
They carry flashlights instead of fires.

23
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:57,194
In some places, children still perform songs or riddles to get candy.

24
00:01:57,194 --> 00:02:01,929
But most of the time, they just say, "Trick or treat!"
