Why Monkey Has No Home

2
00:00:06,162 --> 00:00:09,628
For five years, there was a famine.

3
00:00:09,628 --> 00:00:14,635
The farmers asked people to bless them, and finally they had a good harvest.

4
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:19,642
Since there was now plenty of food, the pharaoh decided to have a party.

5
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:22,595
The party was a happy affair.

6
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:26,318
For five days, they had a huge feast.

7
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,500
Monkey was very happy.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,351
Because of the famine, he was very slim.

9
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:34,919
He wanted to eat a lot of food.

10
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:40,311
When he arrived at the feast hundreds of long tables were filled with food.

11
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:44,676
There were nuts, bowls of cereal, and ripe fruit.

12
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:49,426
He could also smell hot roasted meat cooking on the stove.

13
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:52,892
The assembly of animals was merry.

14
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:59,182
However, during the meal, Monkey thought of a scheme to exploit the pharaoh's kindness.

15
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:03,963
He decided to steal some of the food and then eat it at home.

16
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,933
All the animals were cheerful.

17
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,646
They didn't notice that Monkey was hiding food.

18
00:01:10,646 --> 00:01:15,419
After the feast, Monkey took the food to his house and ate it.

19
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:19,981
He repeated this routine every day for four days.

20
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:24,117
But on the fifth day, the pharaoh had a surprise.

21
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:27,406
He was going to give all the animals a home.

22
00:01:27,406 --> 00:01:30,164
Monkey was very excited.

23
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:35,361
But when he arrived at the pharaoh's home, he could not get through the door.

24
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:41,779
The diameter of his waist was wider than the door, He was too fat!

25
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:45,651
Monkey asked the pharaoh to forgive him for his theft.

26
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:48,462
But the pharaoh said no.

27
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:51,273
"Pardon?" asked the monkey.

28
00:01:51,273 --> 00:01:55,728
He didn't understand why the pharaoh was being unkind.

29
00:01:55,728 --> 00:02:00,448
"Everybody else will have a home now, but not you.

30
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:05,805
Now you know that greed gets you nothing," explained the pharaoh.
