The Boy and His Sled

2
00:00:05,682 --> 00:00:09,251
Mike was the smallest child in school.

3
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:13,195
Another boy, Joe, always teased Mike.

4
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:18,361
Joe had a large scar on his face from fighting other children.

5
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:24,700
One day, Joe offended Mike when he made fun of Mike's valentine, Jane.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,865
This was disgraceful, but Mike didn't know how to make Joe stop.

7
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:33,199
That day, Mike walked home down an alley.

8
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:37,097
He found a bunch of wood boards next to a pine tree.

9
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:46,394
He thought to himself,
"I could build a decent sled from these.
If I let Joe use it,
he will be nicer to me and Jane."

10
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:48,742
He took the wood home.

11
00:00:48,742 --> 00:00:52,076
Mike got an ax and cut the wood.

12
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:56,397
He used nails to make sure that the pieces were not loose.

13
00:00:56,397 --> 00:01:00,294
As he worked, he bumped his elbow on the boards.

14
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:03,628
The painful sensation made him want to cry.

15
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:11,470
It was a hard chore, but he persisted.
He worked overnight.
By morning, the sled was finished.

16
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:18,608
Mike called Joe on the telephone.
He said, "Hi, Joe. Come over to my house right away."

17
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:22,364
Joe didn't know why Mike wanted him to come over.

18
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:31,051
When Joe arrived, Mike told him,
"Joe, it irritated me the other day when you said mean things about Jane.

19
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:34,432
You weren't kidding when you said those mean things.

20
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:42,181
But I'm not like you.
I just built this sled, and I'll let you ride it with me if you are nice."

20
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:47,393
They became friends, and Joe was grateful that Mike was so nice to him.

21
00:01:47,393 --> 00:01:52,511
He learned that it is more fun to be nice than to be mean.
