Dalton vs. the Bully

2
00:00:05,785 --> 00:00:13,410
Dalton was a nice boy, but sometimes the other boys made fun of him because he was so tall and skinny.

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:20,089
Dalton's biggest problem was Mitch.
He was a bully who boasted about his strength.

4
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:28,872
He quarreled with the other boys.
Sometimes, if boys gave Mitch their lunch money,
he would have mercy and leave them alone.

5
00:00:28,872 --> 00:00:36,655
One day, the boys learned about a special Middle School Olympics.
Their gym class was going to be in it.

6
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:42,860
Many kids were excited.
But Dalton thought it sounded like torture.

7
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,909
That morning, Dalton ate plenty of carbohydrates for breakfast.

8
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:53,694
He entered the gym and looked at the dial on the clock.
It was time to begin.

9
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:59,636
The teacher asked if they were ready.
Everyone nodded, except Dalton.

10
00:00:59,636 --> 00:01:08,629
"I got stung by a bee. I need to see the nurse," said Dalton.
He made this story up so he wouldn't have to play.

11
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:13,993
"I don't believe you. Get ready to play," responded the coach.

12
00:01:13,993 --> 00:01:23,459
First, they wrestled. Then, they jumped, crawled, and played other games.
But Mitch was dominant in every event.

13
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:32,189
They strained all morning to defeat him.
By lunch, the entire team was sore, but they thought they knew how to win.

14
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,923
They knew the last game of the day was volleyball.

15
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:40,498
Kids who used to be Dalton's rivals became his allies.

16
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:44,022
They wanted him to help them beat Mitch.

17
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:49,228
Dalton was going to be Mitch's opponent.
The game started.

18
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:54,277
Every time Mitch tried to hit the ball over the net, Dalton stopped it.

19
00:01:54,277 --> 00:01:57,958
Finally, Mitch used all of his strength.

20
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:02,849
But the ball bounced off Dalton's hands and back into Mitch's face!

21
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:06,110
Finally, Mitch was defeated.
