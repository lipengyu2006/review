00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,592
The Helpful Apprentice

2
00:00:05,592 --> 00:00:12,842
There was once a small restaurant.
People said that the best chef in the world worked there.

3
00:00:12,842 --> 00:00:21,748
But the chef was a horrible person to work for.
He was impolite and scolded his workers all the time.

4
00:00:21,748 --> 00:00:30,241
The chef had a young apprentice.
The apprentice's first priority was to make the best food in the world.

5
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:35,367
He was happy to have a good teacher, but he didn't like the chef.

6
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:42,824
The boy was a diligent worker,
but the chef scolded him more than anyone else.

7
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:50,694
Then one day, the chef got great news.
The emperor wanted to have dinner there that night.

8
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:57,374
He was very excited.
He was working very fast, and he made a mistake.

9
00:00:57,374 --> 00:01:02,086
He cut his hand with a knife, and it started to bleed.

10
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:07,316
The apprentice gave him a bandage, but the chef still couldn't cook.

11
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:12,702
The chef started to panic.
The apprentice tried to assure him.

12
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:18,812
"Everything will be OK," he said.
But the chef was still afraid.

13
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:23,576
Then they started to work together.
They began to bond.

14
00:01:23,576 --> 00:01:29,324
The chef told the apprentice what to do, and the boy cooked a great meal.

15
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:33,259
As soon as they finished, the emperor arrived.

16
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:39,991
He wore a beautiful robe made of soft fibers.
He also had a massive crown.

17
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:44,237
Everyone in the restaurant kneeled when the emperor came in.

18
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,499
The chef and the boy brought out his food.

19
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:55,266
The emperor was used to luxuries.
Would he like the food?
The emperor loved the food.

20
00:01:55,266 --> 00:02:04,225
After his departure, the chef was very proud and very thankful to his new friend, the apprentice.
