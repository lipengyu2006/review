The Shepherd and the Wild Sheep

2
00:00:06,396 --> 00:00:12,791
Once, there was a shepherd.
Every night, he gathered and counted his sheep.

3
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:16,235
He made sure never to overlook any of them.

4
00:00:16,235 --> 00:00:20,466
One night, he saw some wild sheep had joined his herd.

5
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:23,320
He hoped to acquire the newcomers.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,370
It snowed that night.

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,011
In the morning, the shepherd couldn't take his sheep out of his lodge.

8
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:33,356
Instead, he had to feed them inside.

9
00:00:33,356 --> 00:00:39,457
He gave a small amount of wheat to his own sheep.
But he gave more of the food to the wild sheep.

10
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:43,392
He thought the extra wheat would discourage them from leaving.

11
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:49,591
It snowed for several days.
During that time, the shepherd's sheep ate very little.

12
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,937
The wild sheep, however, ate very well.

13
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:56,872
At last, the snow melted, and they ventured outdoors.

14
00:00:56,872 --> 00:01:01,891
As soon as he opened the door of his hut, the wild sheep started to run away.

15
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:10,549
"Wait! This is how you repay me?
After I treated you so kindly, why did you run away?" the shepherd asked.

16
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:13,206
His voice was full of hatred.

17
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:17,388
The wild sheep stopped and turned toward the shepherd.

18
00:01:17,388 --> 00:01:23,685
"We're leaving because you fed us better than your own sheep," one of the wild sheep replied.

19
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:32,492
"You tried to deceive us with your ridiculous plan.
Yesterday, you treated us kindly, but tomorrow you might be different.

20
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:38,149
If more wild sheep joined your herd, you would treat us as inferior sheep."

21
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:42,872
As the wild sheep ran away, the shepherd understood his offense.

22
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:46,956
He knew this awkward situation was his own fault.

23
00:01:46,956 --> 00:01:50,449
He had not been a satisfactory caretaker.

24
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:53,548
He was a fake friend to the wild sheep.

25
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:57,828
Because of this, he had neglected his own sheep.
