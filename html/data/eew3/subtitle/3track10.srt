00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,512
Anna the Babysitter

2
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:11,130
Since her parents got a divorce, Anna has had to help her mother.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,059
In her mother's absence, Anna takes care of Grace, the baby.

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,086
At first, Anna thought it was an easy job.

5
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:27,718
One afternoon, Anna played with Grace.
She meowed like a cat, and Grace imitated her.

6
00:00:27,718 --> 00:00:32,859
In fact, Grace reproduced every sound that Anna made.

7
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:35,721
Anna then took her sister outside.

8
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:42,823
She put Grace in the wagon, but there was nowhere for them to go.
So they went back inside.

9
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:47,116
Anna put the infant on the floor and went into her room.

10
00:00:47,116 --> 00:00:51,197
But when she came back, Grace had vanished!

11
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:58,563
Anna looked everywhere, but she could not find her sister.
Maybe the baby had been kidnapped!

12
00:00:58,563 --> 00:01:05,029
"Where are you?" Anna called aloud.
The situation was becoming urgent.

13
00:01:05,029 --> 00:01:12,131
She wanted to call her mom,
but she didn't want her to think Anna couldn't do the job.

14
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:16,371
Anna sat down.
What was she going to do?

15
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:21,830
But then, Anna heard something.
It was coming from her room.

16
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:30,151
"Grace?" She got down on her knees and looked under the bed.
She could see Grace's bald head.

17
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:35,451
Grace had followed Anna into her room and crept under the bed.

18
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:42,287
"What a relief!" Anna cried.
She picked up her sister and patted her on the head.

19
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:45,573
Her head was soft and had no wrinkles.

20
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:53,947
Grace was sucking on her thumb and looked tired.
So, Anna wrapped her in a blanket and sang rhymes for her.

21
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,233
Then, she put Grace in bed for a nap.

22
00:01:57,233 --> 00:02:03,381
After that afternoon, Anna knew that taking care of Grace was not an easy job.

23
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:07,091
It is a lot of work to take care of a baby!
