    According to
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">
      rumors
    </strong>
    , there’s lots of
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">
      precious
    </strong>
    gold hidden in the jungles of Peru. It got there when the Spanish
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">
      conquered
    </strong>
    parts of South America. The Spanish
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">
      noble
    </strong>
    , Francisco Pizarro, arrived in Peru in the 1500s. He found a group of
    people called the Incas. The Incas believed that their leader, Atahualpa,
    was both a king and a god. But Pizarro didn’t agree.
  </p>
  <p>
    “It is a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">
      sin
    </strong>
    for a man to think he is God!” he said to Atahualpa.
  </p>
  <p>
    Atahualpa thought Pizarro was
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="7">
      insulting
    </strong>
    his
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">
      heritage
    </strong>
    . He thought the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">
      blonde
    </strong>
    Spanish men held
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="12">
      prejudices
    </strong>
    against the Incas. But Atahualpa was a kind man and didn’t want to fight
    the Spaniards. He said, “If I give you a room full of gold, will you leave
    my country in peace?”
  </p>
  <p>
    Pizarro was
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">
      suspicious
    </strong>
    . He thought Atahualpa was
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">
      exaggerating
    </strong>
    . But a few days later, Pizarro returned to the Inca palace with his
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">
      ambassadors
    </strong>
    . He saw a room filled with
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">
      stacks
    </strong>
    of gold. There were golden
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">
      necklaces
    </strong>
    , cups, plates and
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">
      vases
    </strong>
    . It was a great
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">
      spectacle
    </strong>
    . He
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">
      acknowledged
    </strong>
    that Atahualpa had told the truth. But after seeing the gold, he wanted
    all of Peru’s gold. So he didn’t leave the country.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Spanish soldiers stayed in Peru and grabbed all the gold they could
    find. But the Inca people tricked the Spaniards. They mixed the gold with
    tin so that it was poor quality. They gave this gold to the Spaniards.
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">
      Meanwhile
    </strong>
    , they hid the good gold. They stuffed it into sacks and
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">
      dragged
    </strong>
    it deep into the jungle. The Spanish conquerors never found the gold.
    People think it is still there today.
