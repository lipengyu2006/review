    Hans was lazy. He
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">
      seldom
    </strong>
    helped his mother with anything. He didn’t cook and he never
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">
      mowed
    </strong>
    the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">
      lawn
    </strong>
    . He didn’t even
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">
      shave
    </strong>
    ! He spent the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">
      daytime
    </strong>
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">
      gambling
    </strong>
    with his mother’s money. One day, his mother realized that her money was
    gone from her
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">
      purse
    </strong>
    . “You’re
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">
      banned
    </strong>
    from my house!” she shouted. “Don’t come back until you’ve learned your
    lesson!”
  </p>
  <p>
    Hans went to live in the forest like an
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="12">
      outlaw
    </strong>
    . But it was cold, and Hans couldn’t find food. He went to a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">
      cottage
    </strong>
    to ask for a meal.
  </p>
  <p>
    An
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">
      Aborigine
    </strong>
    answered the door. “Can I stay here please?” Hans asked.
  </p>
  <p>
    “You can stay if you work,” the man replied.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hans liked the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">
      prospect
    </strong>
    of food and warmth, so he agreed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The man pointed to a field. “Take this
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">
      rod
    </strong>
    and plant it over there. I am a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">
      wizard
    </strong>
    , and this magic rod will bring us food.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The field was far away. Hans knew it would be hard to walk there. So he
    just threw the rod behind the cottage and sat by the river. When daylight
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="7">
      faded
    </strong>
    , he returned to the cottage and went to sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next morning, the old man looked very
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">
      fierce
    </strong>
    . “You didn’t take the rod to the field!” he shouted.
  </p>
  <p>
    “No,”
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">
      confessed
    </strong>
    Hans, “it was too far!”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Because of you we have nothing to eat!” replied the man.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hans was
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="18">
      terrified
    </strong>
    that the man would punish him. So he ran home. “Mama!” he cried, “I’m
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">
      desperate
    </strong>
    to come back!” His mother was
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">
      cautious
    </strong>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    “Do you promise to work?” she asked.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Yes!” said Hans, “I’ll never be lazy again!”
