    The nation of Greenland isn’t very green. The sun’s
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">
      rays
    </strong>
    don’t shine there for three whole months. As a result, it’s covered with
    snow, ice and
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">
      frost
    </strong>
    . Then how was the name
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">
      derived
    </strong>
    ? It started with a Viking named Erik the Red. Erik had many
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">
      merits
    </strong>
    . However, there was an
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="18">
      underlying
    </strong>
    problem . . . he got angry easily. People were scared of him. However,
    he was married to the niece of a very powerful man. So everybody tried
    to be nice to him.

  <p>
    One day, Erik fought with his neighbor and killed him. His
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">
      consequent
    </strong>
    punishment was to leave Iceland.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many stories
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">
      circulated
    </strong>
    about a land west of Iceland. But only a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">
      fraction
    </strong>
    of the people in Iceland believed them. Still, Erik wanted to find it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Erik sailed toward the land
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">
      via
    </strong>
    the Atlantic Ocean. His
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">
      marine
    </strong>
    knowledge was good, but the trip was hard. Some of his men
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">
      drowned
    </strong>
    . Erik’s
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">
      lieutenant
    </strong>
    wanted to
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">
      resign
    </strong>
    from his position. Others thought about committing
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">
      suicide
    </strong>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    Suddenly, Erik thought he saw something. “I don’t believe it,” said Erik.
    “It must be an
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="7">
      illusion
    </strong>
    .” But it was no trick—it was the new land!
  </p>
  <p>
    Erik
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">
      trembled
    </strong>
    in the cold
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">
      polar
    </strong>
    air. He saw that there was ice everywhere. He realized that the ice could
    keep enemies out. Not even the best
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="12">
      navy
    </strong>
    could
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">
      invade
    </strong>
    the new land. He could start a new
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">
      dynasty
    </strong>
    in his name. But how could he convince people to live here?
  </p>
  <p>
    “I’ll call it ‘Greenland,’” he said. Erik’s plan worked Within two years,
    over a thousand people moved to Greenland. In the end, Greenland got its
    name all because of a trick.
