    A town was fighting for their
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">
      independence
    </strong>
    from another country. Several
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">
      rebels
    </strong>
    started a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">
      revolution
    </strong>
    . However, they were afraid of an
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">
      invasion
    </strong>
    from a lot of
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">
      troops
    </strong>
    . They didn’t have enough
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">
      warriors
    </strong>
    to stop them, so they asked a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="7">
      knight
    </strong>
    for help.
  </p>
  <p>
    The knight made a plan. A tall mountain was outside the town. The road
    near the top was very narrow.
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">
      Cliffs
    </strong>
    rose on both sides of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    “ We must trick the enemy. They have to follow us up the mountain,” the
    knight explained. “ On the narrow path, only a few can attack us at one
    time.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The people agreed with the knight’s plan.
  </p>
  <p>
    The knight put on his
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">
      armor
    </strong>
    , and the warriors got their
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="12">
      spears
    </strong>
    . When the enemy attacked, the knight and warriors acted as if they were
    afraid. They quickly
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="18">
      withdrew
    </strong>
    toward the mountain.
  </p>
  <p>
    The enemy troops followed them up the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">
      steep
    </strong>
    path. Soon, the enemy became tired.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">
      summit
    </strong>
    , the knight and his troops stopped. The enemy was close behind them.
    But now they were tired. Also, only a few could attack because the path
    was narrow. The knight and the warriors fought the enemy. But there were
    too many troops.
  </p>
  <p>
    The knight was afraid. If the warriors
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">
      yielded
    </strong>
    the path to the enemy, the town would be lost.
  </p>
  <p>
    A storm suddenly came over the mountain. There was strong wind and rain.
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">
      Thunder
    </strong>
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">
      boomed
    </strong>
    .
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">
      Lightning
    </strong>
    struck some trees near the enemy. The trees
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">
      blazed
    </strong>
    . The
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">
      flames
    </strong>
    scared the enemy and they
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">
      retreated
    </strong>
    . They ran down the mountain, out of the town, and never returned.
  </p>
  <p>
    The knight explained, “ With a little luck, a good plan beats even a big
    army.”
