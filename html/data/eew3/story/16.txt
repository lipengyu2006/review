    Matthew was a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">
      sensible
    </strong>
    boy. He always kept his room
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">
      tidy
    </strong>
    and had a natural
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">
      literary
    </strong>
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">
      aptitude
    </strong>
    . One day, he hoped to have a career in
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">
      journalism
    </strong>
    . The
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">
      adolescent
    </strong>
    spent much of his time reading and liked having privacy. But his quiet
    personality
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">
      hindered
    </strong>
    his ability to make friends.
  </p>
  <p>
    One day, Matthew went to the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">
      pharmacy
    </strong>
    to pick up some
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">
      pills
    </strong>
    for his grandmother. He saw some boys leaning against a pole outside.
    One of the boys
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">
      complimented
    </strong>
    Matthew. “ I like your jacket.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Another boy asked, “ Do you want to go to Nate’s Restaurant?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “ Sure!” Matthew said.
  </p>
  <p>
    The boys walked to the restaurant. They were going to have
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">
      slices
    </strong>
    of pizza. They ordered their food and drank soda with
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">
      straws
    </strong>
    . They ate until their bellies
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="18">
      swelled
    </strong>
    up. Matthew was having so much fun.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the boys said, “ Let’s leave without paying.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Matthew didn’t want to. But he
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">
      presumed
    </strong>
    his new friends wouldn’t like him if he didn’t.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suddenly, the waiter yelled, “ Stop!” The two other boys ran, leaving
    Matthew there alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Soon, the police arrived. “ Leaving without paying for your meal is the
    same as stealing,” said the police officer. “ The restaurant wants
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">
      justice
    </strong>
    . So next week you have to go to court and let a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">
      jury
    </strong>
    decide your punishment.”
  </p>
  <p>
    When he went to court, the judge asked, “ Do you have anything to say,
    Matthew?”
  </p>
  <p>
    He said, “ I feel
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">
      sorrow
    </strong>
    for what I’ve done. Now I know that real friends won’t ask you to do something
    illegal.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The jury then let him have his
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">
      liberty
    </strong>
    . But they made Matthew pick up trash as
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">
      punishment
    </strong>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    Much to Matthew’s surprise, he ended up meeting some new friends.
