    Paul and John were brothers. They fought all the time because they both
    wanted to be leaders of the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">
      agency
    </strong>
    they both worked at.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">
      superstition
    </strong>
    in their town about a magic cup. People said the cup was in a volcano
    located far away. Anyone who
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="12">
      retrieved
    </strong>
    the cup would have their wish come true. John and Paul both wanted to
    find it. Then they could become the leader.
  </p>
  <p>
    They both left to find the cup. Before their trip, their mother said they
    should work together. They
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">
      dismissed
    </strong>
    that idea. Even though their trips
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">
      originated
    </strong>
    from the same house, each wanted to travel alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    They were both
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">
      miserable
    </strong>
    during the trip. They had to
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">
      navigate
    </strong>
    small boats across
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">
      shallow
    </strong>
    rivers and climb difficult
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">
      slopes
    </strong>
    . Their journey
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">
      spanned
    </strong>
    many days. When they finally got close to the volcano, the ground began
    to
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="18">
      vibrate
    </strong>
    and the volcano
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">
      erupted
    </strong>
    .
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">
      Ash
    </strong>
    filled the sky and
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="7">
      lava
    </strong>
    covered everything. John climbed to the top of a hill to keep from getting
    burned. A few moments later, his brother went up the same hill. They were
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">
      confined
    </strong>
    to the hill until the lava cooled down.
  </p>
  <p>
    They talked about the things they had seen while
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">
      wandering
    </strong>
    around the country. They felt more
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">
      sympathy
    </strong>
    and
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">
      affection
    </strong>
    for each other than ever before. They decided that
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">
      fate
    </strong>
    had brought them together.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next day they left to finish the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">
      remainder
    </strong>
    of the trip together. Everything seemed much easier. When they finally
    found the cup, they learned that it didnâ€™t make wishes come true. It was
    only an ordinary cup. But the trip to reach the cup taught them to work
    together and love each other.
