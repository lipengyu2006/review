  <p>Joe was a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">carpenter</strong>. He built houses in the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">highlands</strong>. Joe’s wife Stella used a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">needle</strong>and
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">thread</strong>to
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">sew</strong>
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">elegant</strong>clothing. She only used beautiful
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">fabric</strong>to make clothes.</p>
  <p>Since they didn’t have a lot of money, they lived in an old
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">shed</strong>. Water
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="7">dripped</strong>in when it rained. They had broken chairs instead of a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">couch</strong>. But they had
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">coal</strong>for heat, and flour from the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="12">mill</strong>for bread. Together, they
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="18">trimmed</strong>the bushes to make their house look nice. Joe and Stella were poor, but not
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">ashamed</strong>. They were happy.</p>
  <p>Sometimes in the evening, they walked downtown. They looked in store windows and dreamed. Stella wanted a hairbrush with an
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">ivory</strong>handle. She pulled her hair
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">upwards</strong>every day because she didn’t have a brush to make it nice. Joe wanted to fix his grandfather’s watch.</p>
  <p>For their
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">anniversary</strong>, Stella wanted to get Joe what he wanted. But then she did the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">arithmetic</strong>. It would take at least six months to save enough money. Then she had an idea. She cut off all of her hair and sold it.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Joe knew that he could never fix his watch. So he
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">polished</strong>it and sold it. He made enough to buy the brush.</p>
  <p>On their anniversary, the door
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">burst</strong>open. Joe was excited to give Stella his gift. But first, Stella gave him the money to fix the watch. When he saw his wife without any hair, he smiled. “ I sold my watch to buy you something,” Joe said. He gave her the brush, and she laughed. They were both willing to give up something very special to make each other happy.</p>
