  <p>Dalton was a nice boy, but sometimes the other boys made fun of him because he was so tall and skinny. Dalton’s biggest problem was Mitch. He was a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">bully</strong>who
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">boasted</strong>about his strength. He
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">quarreled</strong>with the other boys. Sometimes, if boys gave Mitch their lunch money, he would have
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">mercy</strong>and leave them alone.</p>
  <p>One day, the boys learned about a special Middle School Olympics. Their gym class was going to be in it. Many kids were excited. But Dalton thought it sounded like
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="18">torture</strong>.</p>
  <p>That morning, Dalton ate plenty of
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">carbohydrates</strong>for breakfast. He entered the gym and looked at the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">dial</strong>on the clock. It was time to begin. The teacher asked if they were ready. Everyone
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">nodded</strong>, except Dalton.</p>
  <p>“ I got
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">stung</strong>by a bee. I need to see the nurse.” said Dalton. He made it up so he wouldn’t have to play.</p>
  <p>“ I don’t believe you. Get ready to play,” responded the coach.</p>
  <p>First, they
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">wrestled</strong>. Then they jumped,
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">crawled</strong>and played other games. But Mitch was
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">dominant</strong>in every event.</p>
  <p>They
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">strained</strong>all morning to
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="7">defeat</strong>him. By lunch, they were
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">sore</strong>. Their entire bodies
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">ailed</strong>them. They thought about how to win. They knew the last game of the day was volleyball. Kids who used to be Dalton’s
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">rivals</strong>became his
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">allies</strong>. They wanted him to help them beat Mitch. Dalton was going to be Mitch’s
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="12">opponent</strong>.</p>
  <p>The game started. Every time Mitch tried to hit the ball over the net, Dalton stopped it. Finally, Mitch used all of his strength. But the ball
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">bounced</strong>off Dalton’s hands and back into Mitch’s face! Finally Mitch was defeated.</p>
