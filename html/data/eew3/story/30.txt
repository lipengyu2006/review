    “Where am I?” Bob thought to himself when he woke up on a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">
      peculiar
    </strong>
    beach. “I can’t remember what happened.” There had been a bad storm, and
    Bob’s fishing boat sunk. He washed ashore on a small island, but he had
    gotten hurt during the storm. He had a terrible
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">
      migraine
    </strong>
    , and he had a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">
      fracture
    </strong>
    in his shoulder. He felt awful. But he had a strong desire to make it
    home to his
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">
      spouse
    </strong>
    and children. He had to
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">
      tolerate
    </strong>
    all the pain and
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">
      devise
    </strong>
    a plan.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bob stood up and looked around. “I’ll walk to a higher
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">
      altitude
    </strong>
    , so I can see everything around me,” thought Bob. “Maybe I’ll gain some
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">
      insight
    </strong>
    about this island and find something to help me escape.” As he walked
    along a mountain
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">
      ridge
    </strong>
    , he noticed that the tall
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">
      indigenous
    </strong>
    trees looked sturdy and thick. Bob got a brilliant idea. He could build
    a raft! He cut down some leaves and tree
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">
      limbs
    </strong>
    . Even though his shoulder injury
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">
      impaired
    </strong>
    his ability to carry the materials, he slowly dragged them down the mountain
    until he reached the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">
      coastline
    </strong>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    Bob was a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">
      proficient
    </strong>
    builder. He used his building
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">
      expertise
    </strong>
    to line up the limbs and tie them together with long vines. When the raft
    was finished, Bob was happy with his work. “This will bring me home to
    my family,” he said with a smile.
  </p>
  <p>
    At last, Bob was ready to
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="7">
      implement
    </strong>
    his escape plan. With all his might, he
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="18">
      thrust
    </strong>
    the raft into the water. He climbed on and began the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">
      quest
    </strong>
    to find his way home. Bob smiled again, and thought, “I’m glad I kept
    a good attitude. It prevented the pain from
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">
      deterring
    </strong>
    me from my plan.
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="12">
      Optimism
    </strong>
    and ambition make anything possible.” Slowly, he floated out to sea. In
    a few days, he made it to shore and ran home to see his happy family.
