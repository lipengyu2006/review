    Marcus lived in a small
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">
      suburb
    </strong>
    near the sea. He was a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">
      stubborn
    </strong>
    boy, and he only cared about himself. His father worked as a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">
      chemist
    </strong>
    for an
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">
      institution
    </strong>
    and wanted Marcus to get a job there. Instead, the boy delivered milk.
    Each morning he took
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">
      dairy
    </strong>
    products to the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">
      grocers
    </strong>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    One day, Marcus was
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">
      jogging
    </strong>
    down the street with a gallon of milk to give to a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="12">
      merchant
    </strong>
    . He didn’t want to be late. He ran down a path beside a large
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">
      canal
    </strong>
    . A wall there kept water from coming into the town during high
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="18">
      tide
    </strong>
    . But Marcus saw a small hole in the wall. Marcus knew that if the wall
    broke, it would be a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">
      tragedy
    </strong>
    for the town.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first, he
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">
      hesitated
    </strong>
    . He had to choose between helping himself and helping the town. There
    was only one way to save the town. It seemed crazy to him, but it was the
    only thing he could do. He
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">
      poked
    </strong>
    his finger into the hole. This didn’t fix the problem forever, but it
    did
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">
      postpone
    </strong>
    the tragedy.
  </p>
  <p>
    His finger
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">
      ached
    </strong>
    . He felt the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">
      chill
    </strong>
    of the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">
      arctic
    </strong>
    water as it
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">
      splashed
    </strong>
    him. There was no one else around. He knew he had to wait until the tide
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="7">
      descended
    </strong>
    . It was very difficult, but Marcus stayed there and saved the town.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the tide had descended, Marcus told everyone what happened. A group
    of people went to the wall. They saw the hole and fixed it. Everyone was
    very happy with Marcus. The local
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">
      congress
    </strong>
    even gave him a gift for saving the town. He was a hero.
