    A man looked through some boxes with his grandson. They were filled with
    old photographs and objects that
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">
      portrayed
    </strong>
    important events from the grandfather’s life. He wished to share the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">
      circumstances
    </strong>
    behind each event with his grandson.
  </p>
  <p>
    The grandson, however, thought his grandfather’s stories were boring.
    The grandfather
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">
      coped
    </strong>
    with this. He ignored his grandson’s
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">
      criticism
    </strong>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    He took a photo from the box. “That’s the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="18">
      submarine
    </strong>
    I was on during the war,” he explained. The grandson
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">
      gazed
    </strong>
    at it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The grandfather
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">
      glanced
    </strong>
    at the next picture and
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="7">
      frowned
    </strong>
    . It showed a row of
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">
      coffins
    </strong>
    . His grandson noticed the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">
      grief
    </strong>
    in his grandfather’s face.
  </p>
  <p>
    “What is it?” the boy inquired.
  </p>
  <p>
    “This was after a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">
      nuclear
    </strong>
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">
      bomb
    </strong>
    was dropped,” the grandfather answered. “It
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">
      devastated
    </strong>
    a city.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Next the grandfather pulled a toy
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">
      microscope
    </strong>
    from the box and
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">
      rotated
    </strong>
    it in his hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Where did you get that?” the grandson asked.
  </p>
  <p>
    “This is a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">
      souvenir
    </strong>
    I bought at the science museum,” the grandfather said.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the boy was really interested. He started to understand that his grandfather
    was telling him a larger story. It was the story of his grandfather’s life.
  </p>
  <p>
    He got another photo. It showed a young bride and
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">
      groom
    </strong>
    . They were very happy. A
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">
      certificate
    </strong>
    was attached to the photo. The boy couldn’t read it, but he
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">
      traced
    </strong>
    his finger over paper.
  </p>
  <p>
    “What’s this from, Granddad?” he asked.
  </p>
  <p>
    “That’s my marriage
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="12">
      license
    </strong>
    from the day I married your grandmother,” the grandfather said.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Wow!” said the boy. “Granddad, now I know all about your life!”
