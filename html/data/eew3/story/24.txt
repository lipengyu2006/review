  <p>Travel writers travel around the world and write about their experiences. They post their articles on an online blog or in a magazine. It may seem like the perfect way to earn <strong class="idiom-tip">income</strong>, but there is a lot of hard work involved.</p>
  <p>Travel writers have to be prepared to travel on short notice. Whether getting on a <strong class="idiom-tip">jet</strong> to travel <strong class="idiom-tip">abroad</strong> or boarding a small plane for a <strong class="idiom-tip">domestic</strong> flight, travel writers must have <strong class="idiom-tip">official</strong> documents such as passports. They must also have international <strong class="idiom-tip">currency</strong>. And they must have personal belongings ready at all times. Since travel writers also get paid to write about their trips, a laptop to keep track of all the <strong class="idiom-tip">data</strong> they <strong class="idiom-tip">gather</strong> is important.</p>
  <p>Being good at research is a must for travel writers. They must choose <strong class="idiom-tip">airlines</strong> that offer <strong class="idiom-tip">maximum</strong> travel perks. They must hunt for hotel <strong class="idiom-tip">bargains</strong>. And they must choose the best things to do on a <strong class="idiom-tip">brief</strong> trip.</p>
  <p>Good travel writers must attract an <strong class="idiom-tip">audience</strong> in large <strong class="idiom-tip">volumes</strong>. To do this, they first write <strong class="idiom-tip">drafts</strong> about their experiences. They edit the drafts many times. Since they get paid to <strong class="idiom-tip">recommend</strong> and <strong class="idiom-tip">refer</strong> travelers to hotels, restaurants, and places to visit, their articles have to be well written and inviting to read.</p>
  <p>Getting paid to travel around the world might seem like an exciting profession, but travel writers often endure <strong class="idiom-tip">sleepless</strong> nights and long wait times at the airport. They travel to <strong class="idiom-tip">remote</strong> locations and must adjust to new environments. It takes some time to make these adjustments, but for someone who loves to travel as a <strong class="idiom-tip">hobby</strong> and loves to write, being a travel writer is a great job!</p>
