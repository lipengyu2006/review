    It was a cool morning, and the grass was covered in
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">
      mist
    </strong>
    . The market was full of people. A mean farmer named Jack yelled, “ Pears
    for sale!” He sat on a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">
      bench
    </strong>
    ,
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">
      plotting
    </strong>
    how he could trick people. Then an
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">
      orphan
    </strong>
    came to his cart.
  </p>
  <p>
    “ Can you
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">
      spare
    </strong>
    a pear?” she asked.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jack felt
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">
      rage
    </strong>
    . He replied, “You don’t have any money!”
  </p>
  <p>
    “ Please, I haven’t had
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="18">
      supper
    </strong>
    in days.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “ No!” shouted the farmer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The orphan
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">
      sighed
    </strong>
    . However, a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">
      pregnant
    </strong>
    lady heard the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">
      dispute
    </strong>
    and
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">
      confronted
    </strong>
    Jack. “ Just give her a pear,” she said. Jack had no
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">
      shame
    </strong>
    and said no. Finally, a man bought a pear for the girl.
  </p>
  <p>
    The girl quickly ate it, but she saved the seed. She wanted to get
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="12">
      revenge
    </strong>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    She told Jack, “ I know a way to get hundreds of pears in one day. I’ll
    show you how.”
  </p>
  <p>
    He watched the girl dig a hole. She dropped the seed into the ground.
    Then she spread the dirt over it.
  </p>
  <p>
    “ Watch closely,” she said. “ In a few minutes, a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">
      stem
    </strong>
    will grow. It’ll turn into a tree that’s full of pears!”
  </p>
  <p>
    Jack stared at the dirt, but nothing happened. The only
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="7">
      objects
    </strong>
    there were a few
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">
      daisies
    </strong>
    . He looked for the girl, but she had
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">
      snuck
    </strong>
    away.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then he looked at his cart in
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">
      horror
    </strong>
    . It was empty! He suddenly realized that the orphan had tricked him.
    While Jack was waiting for the tree to grow, the people had taken the pears
    from his cart. They all laughed while they were eating the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">
      tender
    </strong>
    fruit. The farmer felt ashamed. The
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">
      incident
    </strong>
    taught him to be kinder.
