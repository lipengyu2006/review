    When I was young, everything that went wrong in my house seemed to be
    my fault. Once, my brothers tried to make cookies. They
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">
      blended
    </strong>
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="12">
      flour
    </strong>
    and
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">
      ginger
    </strong>
    and made a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="7">
      disgusting
    </strong>
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">
      paste
    </strong>
    . Then they tried to wash it down the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">
      drain
    </strong>
    , but it got all over the floor. Later, my brothers said that I did it
    and I had to
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="18">
      wipe
    </strong>
    it up.
  </p>
  <p>
    I worried that my parents liked them more than me. One
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">

    </strong>
    day, I was sure I would make my parents proud. I bought a model rocket.
    After I put it together, I invited everybody to watch it. I wanted my brothers
    to
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">
      envy
    </strong>
    my technical knowledge. I lit the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">
      fuse
    </strong>
    , but nothing happened.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Looks like your
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">
      fireworks
    </strong>
    don’t work. I hope you kept the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">
      receipt
    </strong>
    so you can return them,” my brother said.
  </p>
  <p>
    “It’s not fireworks!” I screamed. They were making fun of me again.
  </p>
  <p>
    I didn’t know what went wrong. I hadn’t
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">
      altered
    </strong>
    anything. I quickly moved the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">
      wires
    </strong>
    on the bottom, hoping that would help. Suddenly, the rocket flew up. We
    stood
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">
      aside
    </strong>
    as it
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">
      curved
    </strong>
    through the lawn and ran straight into the mailbox. Then the mailbox
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">
      collapsed
    </strong>
    . The rocket was
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">
      crushed
    </strong>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    Embarrassed, I ran inside and hid. A few minutes later, my mom asked,
    “Are you OK?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “I just wanted them to be
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">
      jealous
    </strong>
    of me for once. Now I see why you and Dad don’t love me as much as them,”
    I said.
  </p>
  <p>
    “That’s not true!” said my mom. “See my fingers . . . each one is different.
    You kids are like my fingers: all are different, but I love them all the
    same.”
  </p>
  <p>
    I
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">
      embraced
    </strong>
    her. Now I know that my parents love me just as much as my brothers.
