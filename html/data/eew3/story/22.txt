    Ben was unhappy. He lived on a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">
      ranch
    </strong>
    near a small town, and he didn’t have many friends. Then one day a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">
      messenger
    </strong>
    came to the ranch. He showed the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">
      headline
    </strong>
    in the town newspaper. The
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">
      circus
    </strong>
    was coming to the town. It even
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">
      coincided
    </strong>
    with Ben’s birthday!
  </p>
  <p>
    Ben was very excited as his father
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">
      steered
    </strong>
    the car through the town. The circus couldn’t
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">
      accommodate
    </strong>
    all the people who wanted to see the show, but Ben had a ticket.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ben
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="12">
      peered
    </strong>
    at the activity around him. He watched people of both
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="7">
      genders
    </strong>
    dance all around. They wore funny costumes, and their hair was
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">
      dyed
    </strong>
    many different colors. Also,
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="18">
      tame
    </strong>
    tigers with
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">
      stripes
    </strong>
    on their fur did tricks. Outside, people could
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">
      commission
    </strong>
    an
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">
      informal
    </strong>
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">
      portrait
    </strong>
    . They
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">
      posed
    </strong>
    in front of a funny picture while an artist quickly drew them. Ben couldn’t
    believe it. He was happier than he had ever been before.
  </p>
  <p>
    That day, Ben knew what he wanted to do. He loved the circus to such an
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">
      extent
    </strong>
    that he wanted to have his own circus when he grew older.
  </p>
  <p>
    Seeing the circus was like a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">
      dose
    </strong>
    of medicine for him. He wasn’t unhappy anymore. He felt special. He
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">
      inquired
    </strong>
    about what he needed to do to have his own circus. He studied hard and
    learned about business.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ben worked very hard, and one day, he had his own circus. It was a great
    circus. People told him that he could be very rich. But he wasn’t
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">
      tempted
    </strong>
    by money. He just wanted to make children happy. He knew the circus had
    changed his life, and he wanted to do the same thing for others.
