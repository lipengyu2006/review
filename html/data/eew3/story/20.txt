    Mother Wolf was a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="9">
      magnificent
    </strong>
    animal. She had all the
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="18">
      traits
    </strong>
    of a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="17">
      terrific
    </strong>
    hunter. She was very strong and fast. She knew how to hide and how to
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="14">
      seize
    </strong>
    animals. Mother Wolf was the forest’s
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="16">
      supreme
    </strong>
    creature. Her skills were
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="5">
      evident
    </strong>
    to all the other animals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mother Wolf lived in a den
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="0">
      beneath
    </strong>
    a tree with her
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="1">
      cub
    </strong>
    , Little Wolf. At
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="2">
      dawn
    </strong>
    , Little Wolf and Mother Wolf were eating breakfast. Little Wolf looked
    sad. Mother Wolf said, “ What is wrong, my cub?”
  </p>
  <p>
    Little Wolf said, “ I want to be big like you. You can run and
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="8">
      leap
    </strong>
    better than anyone. You can
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="7">
      howl
    </strong>
    so loudly. Being big is a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="10">
      necessity
    </strong>
    , and I am so small.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Mother Wolf said, “ Don’t be
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="3">
      dissatisfied
    </strong>
    with your size. Being small can be very helpful sometimes.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Just then, rain and
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="6">
      hail
    </strong>
    began to fall. The tree was hit by lightning. It fell on the wolves’ den.
    Little Wolf was scared. The wolves knew that escaping the den was
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="19">
      vital
    </strong>
    . Mother Wolf said, “ Little Wolf, I cannot move the heavy
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="12">
      pile
    </strong>
    of branches. But you can escape with
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="4">
      ease
    </strong>
    . You can get out and find help!”
  </p>
  <p>
    Little Wolf crawled out of the den and called all the large animals for
    help. They went to the den and pulled away the branches. Mother Wolf came
    out and said, “ Thank you Little Wolf! You saved my life!” She softly
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="15">
      squeezed
    </strong>
    Little Wolf and kissed her.
  </p>
  <p>
    Little Wolf smiled. She said, “ Mother, this
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="11">
      outcome
    </strong>
    has taught me a
    <strong class="idiom-tip" idx="13">
      profound
    </strong>
    lesson. Even though I’m small, I’m still important.”
