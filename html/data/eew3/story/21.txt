  <p><strong class="idiom-tip">Cancer</strong> is a disease that develops because of unusual <strong class="idiom-tip">cell</strong> growth in the human body. Cancer cells take over and <strong class="idiom-tip">attack</strong> healthy cells, leaving the normal working cells in a state of <strong class="idiom-tip">destruction</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong class="idiom-tip">Extensive</strong> research has been done to understand the <strong class="idiom-tip">link</strong> between <strong class="idiom-tip">genes</strong> and cancer. A gene is what decides the traits a living thing may <strong class="idiom-tip">inherit</strong>. Genes can be found in the <strong class="idiom-tip">DNA</strong> of each cell in the body. DNA contains a <strong class="idiom-tip">code</strong> that carries all the needed information about the qualities of a living thing. Genes control how cells work by making proteins that have special jobs. These proteins make up everything – bones, teeth, muscles, blood, etc. – in our bodies. Genes pass on the DNA code to proteins that decide eye color, hair color, and skin color. <strong class="idiom-tip">Furthermore</strong>, damaged DNA can sometimes be passed on as well. The damaged DNA can eventually lead to gene changes, which then may <strong class="idiom-tip">result</strong> in a problem in the body. Over time, the problem may become a disease and, sometimes, even become <strong class="idiom-tip">cancerous</strong>.</p>
  <p>There are many different types of cancers. <strong class="idiom-tip">Breast</strong> cancer is the most common in the <strong class="idiom-tip">female</strong> <strong class="idiom-tip">population</strong>, while prostate cancer is most common in the <strong class="idiom-tip">male</strong> population. Drinking alcohol increases the chances of developing cancer in different places of the body such as the head, neck, liver, or throat. <strong class="idiom-tip">Cigarette</strong> smoking is the number one cause of lung cancer in the United States. Studies also show a strong link between eating too much <strong class="idiom-tip">sugar</strong> and a higher risk of cancerous cells growing even faster.</p>
  <p>Although scientists have been studying cancer, there is still no cure for the disease. Hopefully, a <strong class="idiom-tip">cure</strong> will eventually be found and prevent the sadness that comes from losing a loved one to cancer.</p>
