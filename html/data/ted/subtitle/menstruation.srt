00:00:06,322 --> 00:00:15,806
This might seem hard to believe, but right now, 300 million women across the planet are experiencing the same thing: a period.

2
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:22,476
The monthly menstrual cycle that leads to the period is a reality most women on Earth will go through in their lives.

3
00:00:22,476 --> 00:00:25,100
But why is this cycle so universal?

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,545
And what makes it a cycle in the first place?

5
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:35,500
Periods last anywhere between two and seven days, arising once within in a 28-day rotation.

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:42,296
That whole system occurs on repeat, happening approximately 450 times during a woman's life.

7
00:00:42,296 --> 00:00:53,539
Behind the scenes are a series of hormonal controls that fine tune the body's internal workings to make menstruation start or stop during those 28 days.

8
00:00:53,539 --> 00:01:02,654
This inner machinery includes two ovaries stocked with thousands of tiny sacks called follicles that each contain one oocyte, an unfertilized egg cell.

9
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:12,328
At puberty, ovaries hold over 400 thousand egg cells, but release only one each month, which results in pregnancy or a period.

10
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:14,730
Here's how this cycle unfolds.

11
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:26,142
Each month beginning around puberty, the hormone-producing pituitary gland in the brain starts releasing two substances into the blood: follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone.

12
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:31,453
When they reach the ovaries, they encourage the internal egg cells to grow and mature.

13
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:34,424
The follicles respond by pumping out estrogen.

14
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:43,339
The egg cells grow and estrogen levels peak, inhibiting the production of FSH, and telling the pituitary to pump out more LH.

15
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:50,704
That causes only the most mature egg cell from one of the ovaries to burst out of the follicle and through the ovary wall.

16
00:01:50,704 --> 00:01:56,268
This is called ovulation, and it usually happens ten to sixteen days before the start of a period.

17
00:01:56,268 --> 00:01:59,966
The tiny oocyte moves along the fallopian tube.

18
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:06,194
A pregnancy can only occur if the egg is fertilized by a sperm cell within the next 24 hours.

19
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:11,568
Otherwise, the egg's escapade ends, and the window for pregnancy closes for that month.

20
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:25,098
Meanwhile, the now empty follicle begins to release progesterone, another hormone that tells the womb's lining to plump up with blood and nutrients in preparation for a fertilized egg that may embed there and grow.

21
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:36,636
If it doesn't embed, a few days later, the body's progesterone and estrogen levels plummet, meaning the womb stops padding out and starts to degenerate, eventually falling away.

22
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:41,188
Blood and tissue leave the body, forming the period.

23
00:02:41,188 --> 00:02:47,890
The womb can take up to a week to clear out its unused contents, after which the cycle begins anew.

24
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:57,689
Soon afterwards, the ovaries begin to secrete estrogen again, and the womb lining thickens, getting ready to accommodate a fertilized egg or be shed.

25
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:05,023
Hormones continually control these activities by circulating in ideal amounts delivered at just the right time.

26
00:03:05,023 --> 00:03:13,432
The cycle keeps on turning, transforming each day and each week into a milestone along its course towards pregnancy or a period.

27
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:17,826
Although this cycle appears to move by clockwork, there's room for variation.

28
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:20,608
Women and their bodies are unique, after all.

29
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:29,870
Menstrual cycles occur at diffferent times in the month, ovulation comes at various points in the cycle, and some periods last longer than others.

30
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:35,181
Menstruation even begins and ends at different times in life for different women, too.

31
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:39,448
In other words, variations between periods are normal.

32
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:48,647
Appreciating these differences and learning about this monthly process can empower women, giving them the tools to understand and take charge of their own bodies.

33
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:55,633
That way, they're able to factor this small cycle into a much larger cycle of life.
