00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:15,218
In the late 17th century, a medical student named Johannes Hofer noticed a strange illness affecting Swiss mercenaries serving abroad.

2
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:26,115
Its symptoms, including fatigue, insomnia, irregular heartbeat, indigestion, and fever were so strong, the soldiers often had to be discharged.

3
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:33,693
As Hofer discovered, the cause was not some physical disturbance, but an intense yearning for their mountain homeland.

4
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:41,615
He dubbed the condition nostalgia, from the Greek "nostos" for homecoming and "algos" for pain or longing.

5
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:46,499
At first, nostalgia was considered a particularly Swiss affliction.

6
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:54,735
Some doctors proposed that the constant sound of cowbells in the Alps caused trauma to the ear drums and brain.

7
00:00:54,735 --> 00:01:03,440
Commanders even forbade their soldiers from singing traditional Swiss songs for fear that they'd lead to desertion or suicide.

8
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,514
But as migration increased worldwide, nostalgia was observed in various groups.

9
00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:16,403
It turned out that anyone separated from their native place for a long time was vulnerable to nostalgia.

10
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:25,296
And by the early 20th century, professionals no longer viewed it as a neurological disease, but as a mental condition similar to depression.

11
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:34,659
Psychologists of the time speculated that it represented difficulties letting go of childhood, or even a longing to return to one's fetal state.

12
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:40,765
But over the next few decades, the understanding of nostalgia changed in two important ways.

13
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:46,808
Its meaning expanded from indicating homesickness to a general longing for the past.

14
00:01:46,808 --> 00:01:53,196
And rather than an awful disease, it began to be seen as a poignant and pleasant experience.

15
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:58,989
Perhaps the most famous example of this was captured by French author Marcel Proust.

16
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:09,447
He described how tasting a Madeleine cake he had not eaten since childhood triggered a cascade of warm and powerful sensory associations.

17
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:14,019
So what caused such a major reversal in our view of nostalgia?

18
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:16,461
Part of it has to do with science.

19
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:24,039
Psychology shifted away from pure theory and towards more careful and systematic empirical observation.

20
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:32,525
So professionals realized that many of the negative symptoms may have been simply correlated with nostalgia rather than caused by it.

21
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:43,797
And, in fact, despite being a complex emotional state that can include feelings of loss and sadness, nostalgia doesn't generally put people in a negative mood.

22
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:54,944
Instead, by allowing individuals to remember personally meaningful and rewarding experiences they shared with others, nostalgia can boost psychological well-being.

23
00:02:55,944 --> 00:03:07,282
Studies have shown that inducing nostalgia in people can help increase their feelings of self-esteem and social belonging, encourage psychological growth, and even make them act more charitably.

24
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:15,047
So rather than being a cause of mental distress, nostalgia can be a restorative way of coping with it.

25
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:25,193
For instance, when people experience negative emotional states, they tend to naturally use nostalgia to reduce distress and restore well-being.

26
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:34,430
Today, it seems that nostalgia is everywhere, partially because advertisers have discovered how powerful it is as a marketing technique.

27
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:41,914
It's tempting to think of this as a sign of us being stuck in the past, but that's not really how nostalgia works.

28
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:53,311
Instead, nostalgia helps us remember that our lives can have meaning and value, helping us find the confidence and motivation to face the challenges of the future.
