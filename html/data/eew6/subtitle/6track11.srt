1
00:00:02,124 --> 00:00:05,149
"I Didn't Do It!"

2
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:12,708
Billy was in big trouble. The day before, a donor had given the school a painting with a sports theme.

3
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:16,339
It showed a referee congratulating two athletes.

4
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:23,535
The principal had hung the painting in front of the office, hoping that it would be a stimulus for students to play sports.

5
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:31,060
The next morning, however, the painting was destroyed. There was graffiti on it, and it had many holes in it.

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:37,035
The worst part was that one of Billy's fellow students had said she thought she saw Billy do it!

7
00:00:37,035 --> 00:00:44,495
But Billy didn't do it. The principal called Billy's parents and said, "Billy won't tell us the truth.

8
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:52,350
He's a chronic liar, and he ruined the painting. If you don't pay for it, we'll terminate his education here."

9
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,632
Billy's parents didn't have enough money to pay for the painting and for his tuition.

10
00:00:57,632 --> 00:01:04,596
But Billy's parents had an idea. That afternoon, they went to see Mr. Meyers, an attorney.

11
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:11,099
"Mr. Meyers, my son has been implicated in a crime he says he didn't do," Billy's father said.

12
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,413
"Everybody believes the gossip. Even some of our own kin think he did it!"

13
00:01:16,413 --> 00:01:24,797
"I believe you. My suspicion is that the tape from the security cameras will show who really did it," said Mr. Meyers.

14
00:01:24,797 --> 00:01:29,484
The next day, Mr. Meyers received a packet with the videotape from the school.

15
00:01:29,484 --> 00:01:35,294
It showed another student who resembled Billy walking up to the painting and writing on it.

16
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:40,839
Then the student took a knife by the shaft and started to stab large holes in it.

17
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:46,417
Finally, he severed the rope that held up the painting, and it fell to the floor.

18
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:52,458
Mr. Meyers showed the tape to the principal. "Clearly, that's not Bily," he said.

19
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:59,488
"This boy is actually responsible and needs some discipline." Billy was happy that someone believed him.

20
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:09,490
He said to Mr. Meyers, "When I graduate and go to university, I will major in law so I can be a guardian of justice like you!"
