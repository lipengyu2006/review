The Lord and the Farmers

2
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:09,535
A wealthy lord was renovating his mansion.

3
00:00:09,535 --> 00:00:17,676
He had added another story to his home, with large windows that overlooked the farmers' pastures on the eastern border of his land.

4
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:21,563
Around the mansion, he then erected a great wall.

5
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:25,483
He built an arch for the gate out of huge slabs of stone.

6
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:29,570
The lord was overjoyed with the addition to his home.

7
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:35,584
However, one day while he was sitting on the terrace, some farmers knocked at his door.

8
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:42,893
He invited them in. Despite his hospitality, the farmers appeared to be in a foul mood.

9
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:52,063
"Why are you so upset?" the lord asked. One farmer replied, "That is actually the reason for our visit."

10
00:00:52,063 --> 00:01:00,004
He then handed the lord a petition. It alleged that the shadow cast by the mansion was harming their pastures.

11
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:06,782
"Your mansion now casts a shadow over several hectares of our land," the farmer explained.

12
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:12,629
"The turf in the shadow has died, and our cattle now have less grass to eat."

13
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:17,314
"It is too late for me to revise my plans," the lord answered.

14
00:01:17,314 --> 00:01:23,925
"You will just have to live with the change." His reply only heightened the farmers' anger.

15
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:31,069
They left, but they assembled that night outside the mansion's gate. They planned to destroy the mansion.

16
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:36,219
The lord's servants tried to defend the house, but the farmers outnumbered them.

17
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:41,501
The servants fled, and the farmers rushed into the mansion and set it on fire.

18
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:45,521
Everyone got out of the house, and there were no casualties.

19
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:52,499
However, the fire soon spread from the house to the adjoining pastures that belonged to the farmers.

20
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:59,376
Both sides' properties were destroyed. The lord and the farmers were sorry for their actions.

21
00:01:59,376 --> 00:02:05,556
The lord promised to pay for the burned pastures, and the farmers promised to rebuild the mansion.

22
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:10,440
They had learned that when you fight, both sides lose.
