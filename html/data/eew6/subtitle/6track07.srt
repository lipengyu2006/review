Life on the Farm

2
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:13,204
Bill was an excellent capitalist. He financed a large aviation enterprise that made a lot of money.

3
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:18,960
He knew how to maximize monetary gains in every business deal he made.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,400
Bill had one big problem, though. He was unhappy all the time.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,272
Bill knew that he had to do something about it or he would be depressed for the rest of his life. 

6
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:37,273
One day, Bill was in his office when he heard a knock at the door.

7
00:00:37,273 --> 00:00:43,209
"Come in!" Bill said loudly. His accountant, Jane, walked in.

8
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:53,678
Jane said, "Sir, I haven't seen you smile in a year. What are you so sad about? Your company is doing very well." 

9
00:00:53,678 --> 00:01:05,227
Bill told her, "I'm indifferent about my company's success. I have contempt toward my job. I just want to do something I enjoy.

10
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:12,711
I've always loved growing plants as a hobby. I'm going to quit my job and become a farmer!" 

11
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:19,330
"You're crazy!" Jane said.  "I don't think so," Bill replied.

12
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:27,749
"I want the simplicity of a life on a farm. I'm tired of all this stress. Farming will make me happy."

13
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:34,117
The very next day, Bill carried out the preliminary task of buying land and tools.

14
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:43,363
Then he got to work. He sowed many types of seeds. He planted tomatoes, cabbage, carrots, and onions.

15
00:01:43,363 --> 00:01:48,220
"The upcoming summer is going to be very dry," thought Bill.

16
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,581
"I need to irrigate my crops as a precaution in case it doesn't rain enough."

17
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:58,294
He took his spade and dug a ditch down the middle of his farm.

18
00:01:58,294 --> 00:02:05,885
"Water from the stream will flow down the ditch and saturate the soil around every plant," Bill thought.

19
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:13,441
Bill dedicated himself to farming. After a year, his farm was producing very good crops.

20
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:21,068
Most importantly, Bill was happy. He finally had the life he always wanted.
