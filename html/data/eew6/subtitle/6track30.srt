The Shortcut

2
00:00:05,015 --> 00:00:10,585
A truck driver was driving cargo from the outback to the coast.

3
00:00:10,585 --> 00:00:14,337
His load was comprised of many types of ore.

4
00:00:14,337 --> 00:00:22,683
He needed a huge truck to carry its bulk to a ship waiting at a pier on the country's eastern coast.

5
00:00:22,683 --> 00:00:28,540
At the border between two counties, he'd have to pay a tariff on the cargo.

6
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,996
However, he could keep his money if he avoided the station at the border.

7
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:43,988
He worried about getting in trouble for not paying the tariff, but the thought of not having to spend the money outweighed this concern.

8
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:52,410
He took out his road map. To his surprise, it depicted a small road that had a dual advantage.

9
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:59,167
It not only avoided the border station but also was a shorter route to the coast.

10
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:07,054
He decided to take the shortcut. However, along his journey, he soon ran into problems.

11
00:01:07,054 --> 00:01:14,806
First, he had to cross a small wooden bridge. His truck weighed too much for the bridge.

12
00:01:14,806 --> 00:01:19,917
It was analogous to an elephant trying to stand on a tree branch.

13
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:26,425
The bridge started to break as the truck crossed, and the trailer tilted to the right.

14
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:34,101
Fortunately, the truck made it safely across, but most of the ore fell into the river below.

15
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:41,566
Next, it was a very hot day. The thermometer read over 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

16
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:50,525
The truck's engine became too hot, so the driver parked it in the shade of a grove of trees until it cooled down.

17
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:56,516
Later, he took a wrong turn. He stopped and took out his binoculars.

18
00:01:56,516 --> 00:02:03,886
He scanned his surroundings and eventually discovered a landmark that led him back to the proper route.

19
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:09,131
Finally, he arrived at the pier, but the ship wasn't there.

20
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:15,868
When he asked about the ship's whereabouts, a man said that it had left thirty minutes earlier.

21
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:22,511
He had not fulfilled his contract. He realized then the paradox of the shortcut.

22
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:30,703
The shortest route can be the longest, and vice versa, a long route may be the fastest.
