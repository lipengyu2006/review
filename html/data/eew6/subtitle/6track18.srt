The Butler's Bad Day

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:10,669
The Superintendent of Civic Projects was a busy man.

3
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:16,500
He worked every day of the week and had glamorous parties at his house every night.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,973
However, if there was someone busier than him, it was his butler.

5
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:29,866
He worked all day organizing the superintendent's parties and then cleaned up after them late at night.

6
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:38,791
Hence, while the superintendent slept soundly, snoring loudly in his bed, the butler was still awake.

7
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:48,469
Sadly, although the butler was always overworked, his profession's intrinsic nature demanded he never be outspoken.

8
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:54,537
Therefore, his employer never knew the butler hadn't slept for several days.

9
00:00:54,537 --> 00:01:02,470
On any day, the butler might make a mistake. One day, the superintendent said,

10
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:09,807
"This particular party is important. People from the ministry are coming. Everything must be perfect."

11
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:17,978
The butler began preparing at once. First, he went to the attic to get more chairs and tables.

12
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:27,696
But on his descent, he realized he needed to make the food. A gourmet dinner was necessary for such a party.

13
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:33,724
He boiled water in a kettle for soup and chopped some beef into chunks.

14
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:39,832
Just as he was starting the soup, he remembered that he had to sweep the veranda.

15
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:45,266
As he was sweeping it, he realized that he had to clean the sauna.

16
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:51,375
By this time, the first guests had arrived. The veranda was still dirty.

17
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:57,840
There were not enough chairs for the guests to sit on, and the soup was tasteless.

18
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:07,002
Some guests were dissatisfied. They started to make a fuss, and the party was filled with a din of complaints.

19
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:15,807
The superintendent's party was a disaster. He wondered why his butler had made so many mistakes.

20
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:23,819
At last, the butler admitted to being exhausted. His boss felt pity for the butler.

21
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:36,035
He had no idea the butler was so tired. He said, "You should have told me earlier, and then we could have avoided this whole ordeal."
