00:00:02,554 --> 00:00:05,181
The Old Hound

2
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:13,175
Elvis was a dog that loved to run. He possessed all the criteria to be a great racing dog.

3
00:00:13,175 --> 00:00:17,764
He had long legs, lean muscles, and a strong heart.

4
00:00:17,764 --> 00:00:22,761
He was so good that he never lost a race in the northern hemisphere.

5
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:28,127
Spectators who bet on dog races always picked Elvis to win.

6
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:33,382
After ten years of racing, however, Elvis was getting old.

7
00:00:33,382 --> 00:00:41,043
His faculties were not as strong as they used to be. His owner got upset when Elvis started losing.

8
00:00:41,043 --> 00:00:47,409
Elvis's owner wasn't a considerate person, and he did not treat Elvis well.

9
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:55,736
Finally, his owner decided to get rid of him. He threw Elvis into his car and took him to the middle of the forest.

10
00:00:55,736 --> 00:01:05,728
He tossed him out and drove away. Elvis was cold and scared. He decided to follow a small river into the city.

11
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:11,427
Elvis soon found out that the city was a big and impersonal place.

12
00:01:11,427 --> 00:01:23,566
Everywhere he went, he saw signs that said, "No Dogs Allowed." Pedestrians yelled at him. He was sad, hungry, and alone.

13
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:28,637
He thought that all people were as cruel and uncaring as his owner had been.

14
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:35,742
He was ready to give up when he heard a soft voice say, "What a beautiful hound!"

15
00:01:35,742 --> 00:01:44,809
Elvis looked up and saw an old woman. She said, "You're entitled to a better life than this.

16
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:54,173
I can take you to a sanctuary for old dogs like you. I'll cater to all your needs. Would you like to come with me?"

17
00:01:54,173 --> 00:02:03,758
The woman escorted Elvis to a beautiful facility. There was a sign on the external door that said, "Dogs Welcome!"

18
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:09,902
The interior of the building was painted blue, and shiny ornaments hung from the ceiling.

19
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:14,861
There was a heap of tasty bones and bread crusts for consumption.

20
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:19,413
Elvis learned there were kind people in the world after all.

21
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:25,223
He was so thankful that he jumped up and licked the woman's face.
