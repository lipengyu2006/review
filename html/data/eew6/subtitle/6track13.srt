The Man and the Monkey

2
00:00:05,483 --> 00:00:11,799
While flying over a jungle, a wealthy executive's private plane crashed.

3
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:18,114
Some of the crew were hurt, so the pilot decided to stay with them and wait for help.

4
00:00:18,114 --> 00:00:23,976
The arrogant executive, though, didn't care about the welfare of the pilot and crew.

5
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:29,535
Rather, he thought he could walk out of the jungle and find a town to stay in.

6
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:36,796
He followed a trail through a canyon and along a creek. The jungle was actually very stunning.

7
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:43,868
If the arrogant executive had stopped to look around, he might have perceived the jungle's beauty.

8
00:00:43,868 --> 00:00:50,599
But he was in a nasty mood and had no care for the aesthetic value of the jungle.

9
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:55,402
He continued to walk up the steep incline of the jungle's hills.

10
00:00:55,402 --> 00:01:02,247
Soon, he was lost. Several days passed, and fatigue and hunger weakened him.

11
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:09,470
He was very tired and afraid. Just then, a monkey came out of the trees.

12
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:16,164
It was carrying a twig covered in honey. It walked up to a mound where termites lived.

13
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:21,156
He then used the twig like a drill to make a hole in the mound.

14
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:30,459
Then very carefully, it removed the twig from the hole. The sticky twig was covered with termites.

15
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:38,854
Instead of eating the bugs, the monkey offered them to the executive, but he didn't want what the monkey offered.

16
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:44,829
He shouted at the monkey, "Get away from me, you stupid primate!"

17
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:51,371
The executive's stereotype of the monkey was wrong. The monkey was not stupid.

18
00:01:51,371 --> 00:02:02,414
It knew how to find food, whereas the executive did not. He refused the help of the monkey, thereby leaving himself to starve.

19
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:11,906
When the executive was finally found, he was very skinny and sick. He had not eaten for a very long time.

20
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:20,075
Because he held a bias against the primitive ways of the monkey, he had gone hungry and almost died.

21
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:28,735
The executive didn't understand that it was his arrogant attitude that had caused all of his problems.
