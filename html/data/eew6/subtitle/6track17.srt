The Fossil Hunters

2
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:14,098
Tim and Dean were great fossil hunters. They were the very best at finding dinosaur bones.

3
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:19,949
Although Tim and Dean were quite similar, they were outright enemies.

4
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,915
The two men got into vicious arguments all the time.

5
00:00:23,915 --> 00:00:29,648
They couldn't coexist peacefully because their egos were too large.

6
00:00:29,648 --> 00:00:37,188
Tim thought he was the best fossil hunter, while Dean was sure that he was much better than Tim.

7
00:00:37,188 --> 00:00:45,002
One day, Tim was searching for fossils on the periphery of the city when he stumbled on a huge thigh bone.

8
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:52,581
He had never seen anything like it! He took his shovel and carefully excavated the dirt around it.

9
00:00:52,581 --> 00:01:01,299
As he dug, he uncovered more jagged bones. He realized that he had found an entire dinosaur skeleton!

10
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:05,344
Tim couldn't conceive of the magnitude of the find.

11
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:10,567
He could not think of a plan to remove the huge skeleton all by himself.

12
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:16,457
Such an endeavor would be beyond his capability. He needed help.

13
00:01:16,457 --> 00:01:23,172
He tried to think of people who would be capable of helping him remove the skeleton without breaking it.

14
00:01:23,172 --> 00:01:31,536
The only person Tim could think of was Dean, his enemy. Tim ran into the city to find Dean.

15
00:01:31,536 --> 00:01:38,094
Tim found him and said, "Dean, I've found the skeletal remains of a huge animal.

16
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:43,710
But I can't get the skeleton out by myself. Will you please help me?"

17
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:52,270
Dean thought that Tim's claim might be dubious. He replied, "If you're serious about the skeleton, I'll help."

18
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:59,810
Tim excitedly showed Dean the skeleton's locale. They worked together to carefully remove each bone.

19
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,483
To keep the bones together, they tied them with elastic strips.

20
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:08,960
When they were finished, they had uncovered a perfect skeleton.

21
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,083
They used plaster to make a mold of the dinosaur's skull.

22
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:18,816
They engraved their initials into it and gave it to the curator of a local museum.

23
00:02:18,816 --> 00:02:23,686
Tim and Dean found out that they could work very well together.

24
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:28,123
They decided to end their feud and become friends.

25
00:02:28,123 --> 00:02:34,563
By combining their talents, the men became even greater than they were before.
