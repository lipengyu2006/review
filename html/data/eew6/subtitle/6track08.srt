Brothers

2
00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:10,342
John and Mark were brothers, but they were quite different people.

3
00:00:10,342 --> 00:00:16,509
Mark looked very masculine. He had a mustache and was very muscular.

4
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:25,778
He was a sculptor, He made things out of stone. Mark was a good artist, but he was not very intelligent.

5
00:00:25,778 --> 00:00:33,592
John looked nothing like his brother. He was small and weak, but he was very smart.

6
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:39,682
John was an undergraduate in college, and he studied anthropology and history.

7
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:48,492
He knew a lot about ancient cultures. The brothers loved each other very much, but they thought they had nothing in common.

8
00:00:48,492 --> 00:01:00,787
One day, the mayor appointed Mark to build a monument: a statue of Egyptian Pharaoh, Tut. Mark agreed to do the job, but he had a problem.

9
00:01:00,787 --> 00:01:09,712
He had no idea who Pharaoh Tut was! However, he thought he had the competence to build a good statue anyway.

10
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:17,794
He made some crude measurements and sculpted a statue of a very old man with a tattoo on his chest.

11
00:01:17,794 --> 00:01:27,906
Mark was proud of his work, but when John saw the statue, he laughed aloud. "What's so funny?" Mark asked.

12
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:36,448
John replied, "Your ignorance makes me laugh, Don't you know that Tut was only a teenager when he was pharaoh?

13
00:01:36,448 --> 00:01:44,760
Let me help you. I'll supervise your work. I'll give you feedback, and we'll make this a great monument."

14
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:55,561
Mark got another cube of stone. John told him what Tut looked like. "Make him tall, with good posture," John said.

15
00:01:55,561 --> 00:02:02,839
"And make sure there is symmetry in his body." Mark conferred with John about every detail.

16
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:12,338
For ten consecutive days, the brothers worked. At last, the finished statue was situated in front of the museum.

17
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:22,488
Everyone applauded the brothers' good work. "We worked together very well. I guess we are compatible after all," Mark said.

18
00:02:22,488 --> 00:02:30,723
John replied, "I agree! When we combine our talents, we are capable of greatness."
