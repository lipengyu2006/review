The Butler

2
00:00:04,758 --> 00:00:11,266
Greta was an elderly lady who lived alone in a huge, dilapidated mansion.

3
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:18,878
The mansion was in terrible condition. It was covered with filth, and most of the furniture was broken.

4
00:00:18,878 --> 00:00:23,293
Plus, the kitchen sink leaked water all over the floor.

5
00:00:23,293 --> 00:00:30,905
Greta was too old to do housekeeping and repairs herself, so she hired a butler named Gordon.

6
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:38,136
Gordon was a young, muscular man. His muscles were a testament to his strong work ethic.

7
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:43,008
He believed that if he worked hard, great things would happen for him.

8
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:48,869
On his first day, he worked for hours cleaning and making repairs.

9
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:55,796
He swept up mounds of dirt. He tightened the valve underneath the kitchen faucet to stop the leak.

10
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:59,869
He even bought timber to build new stools for the kitchen.

11
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:06,529
He worked so hard that his fingers went numb, and he got cramps in his shoulders.

12
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:13,532
Gordon worked hard every day. Even when tasks were boring, he was never reckless.

13
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:21,791
He made sure there were no flaws in his work. Gordon was worried, however, that Greta wasn't pleased.

14
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:26,625
She never expressed thanks or said that he did a good job.

15
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:31,725
The lack of appreciation evoked unhappy feelings in Gordon.

16
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:39,565
He even thought about quitting. But he decided the right thing to do was to keep working hard.

17
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:47,025
One day, while Gordon was sweeping, Greta said, "Gordon! I have a surprise for you!"

18
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:51,897
He went to Greta's room and saw a beautiful slate statue.

19
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:58,938
It looked just like him! It was decorated with a banner that read: "Welcome home."

20
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:04,685
Greta said, "You've made this ugly old mansion look new again.

21
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:12,107
I'm so thankful for your hard work that I want you to have it. I'll move into a smaller house."

22
00:02:12,107 --> 00:02:21,127
He grinned and gave Greta a big hug. He said, "What bliss! My hard work really paid off!"

23
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:29,729
The two said their farewells, and Gordon spent the afternoon admiring his beautiful new home.
