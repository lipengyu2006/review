Environment Over Convenience

2
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:14,214
Plastic shopping bags are utilized almost everywhere. They are lightweight, strong, and inexpensive.

3
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:18,860
Customers like them because they make carrying goods so convenient.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:25,375
Stores of all kinds print advertising messages on the bags and give them to customers.

5
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:31,480
Why then, are so many countries regulating or even banning their use?

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:38,996
Unfortunately, because of these very attributes, plastic bags have an adverse effect on the environment.

7
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:42,778
Their low cost leads to their overuse.

8
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:52,846
For example, environmental groups have estimated that in Taiwan, citizens used to discard 16 million plastic bags a day.

9
00:00:52,846 --> 00:01:00,408
Residents of the state of Massachusetts in the United States used more than two billion plastic bags per year.

10
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:08,244
Since plastic is made from chemicals found in oil, these single-use bags never break down and decay.

11
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:16,717
When they are thrown away, they last forever -- along roads, in ponds, and eventually, in the oceans.

12
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:23,870
There is no proven or efficient way to remove plastics once they enter large bodies of water.

13
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:32,070
Some animals that dwell in the sea, such as turtles and dolphins, mistake plastic bags for food.

14
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:41,819
If a bag becomes stuffed down their throats, it can cause fatal suffocation. Thousands of animals choke on the bags every year.

15
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:53,117
Eventually, the plastic fragments may break down into smaller pieces, but they can still be ingested by a wide range of sea animals, from oysters to whales.

16
00:01:53,117 --> 00:02:01,089
In this way, microplastics enter the human food chain and cause tragic damage to people's health.

17
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:11,476
Beginning around the year 2000, cities, provinces, and entire countries decided to take action against this form of pollution.

18
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:20,269
At first, municipal governments tried to minimize the use of these bags by requiring stores to charge customers for each one.

19
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:28,606
This reduced the incidence of bags entering the waste stream, yet billions of bags were still being thrown out each day.

20
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:36,578
As the costs of trying to clean the environment rose, more places enacted outright bans on the bags.

21
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:43,298
Now, ecologically-conscious people around the world use alternate means of carrying packages.

22
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:52,865
They bring their own reusable bags when they go shopping, pack their purchases in paper bags, recycle the bags in special collection bins, 

23
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:59,447
or have their purchases boxed and delivered to their homes in biodegradable packaging.
