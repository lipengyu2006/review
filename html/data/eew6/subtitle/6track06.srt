The Weaving Machine

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:10,968
Mr.Joseph Franklin invented a machine that could weave cloth.

3
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:16,010
It wove faster and straighter than anyone could weave by hand.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,482
He decided to take it to two cities on a peninsula: Netherton and Wilton.

5
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:28,155
In these cities, a large proportion of the people worked in the weaving industry.

6
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:36,475
Joseph felt sure he could sell his machine there. Joseph first took his machine to the mayor of Netherton.

7
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:42,358
"Think of the money you will earn from this machine!" Joseph said to him.

8
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:50,889
But the mayor was a people-oriented man. He knew about the people's dependence on weaving for their livelihood.

9
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:58,116
If he bought the machine, the people would lose their jobs. So he refused to buy it. 

10
00:00:58,116 --> 00:01:05,932
Joseph said, "We are no longer in the medieval age! Soon everything will be made by machines.

11
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:15,555
Cloth made by hand will soon be obsolete. If you don't change your archaic ways, your town's income will diminish!" 

12
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:25,347
But the mayor said, "I don't like capitalism. Don't impose your radical ideas on my town. Go away!" 

13
00:01:25,347 --> 00:01:29,213
So Joseph took his machine to the mayor at Wilton.

14
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:38,247
This mayor thought Joseph's machine was spectacular and spent a long time looking at its different components made of brass.

15
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:45,601
The mayor couldn't refute the fact that the machine had drawbacks that would affect the people's jobs.

16
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:54,930
But he realized the machine could bring money and prestige. So he ordered Joseph to build twenty of them. 

17
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,653
Within a year, Wilton was a wealthy city, famous for its wonderful cloth.

18
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:08,839
People no longer wove but worked in managerial jobs at cloth factories instead.

19
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:16,277
Nobody bought the cloth from Netherton anymore. The people of Netherton became poor and hungry. 

20
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:26,741
Finally, the mayor of Netherton called Joseph and said, "Now I realize that your machine is not just a crazy idea.

21
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:35,565
To succeed in business, we must be willing to change." He then ordered twenty weaving machines. 

22
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:45,356
After that, both Netherton and Wilton became rich cities, famous throughout the land for their wonderful cloth.
