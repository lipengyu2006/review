The Soldier's Decision

2
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:10,842
A soldier was captured while fighting in an enemy king's land.

3
00:00:10,842 --> 00:00:15,860
It was well known that this king would make captives fight one another.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:23,332
This was commonplace during his reign. For these fights, the king had built several large arenas.

5
00:00:23,332 --> 00:00:30,365
He often awarded the winners by setting them free or even having them join his elite army corps.

6
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:38,423
The soldier, however, decided he had seen too much violence. He now felt that all life was sacred.

7
00:00:38,423 --> 00:00:46,664
The night before his first match, he made a risky decision. He decided that he would not engage in combat.

8
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:53,294
He knew he might never be set free, but it was a decision that he was willing to accept.

9
00:00:53,294 --> 00:00:59,081
In the morning, he was led from the prisoners' compound to one of the king's arenas.

10
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:04,648
A gate coated in rust stood between him and the floor of the auditorium.

11
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:08,274
He was worried, but he knew what he had to do.

12
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:16,406
When the gate opened, he calmly walked to the center of the arena and sat. He started to meditate.

13
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:28,566
His foe, Darius, who was skilled in the realm of sword fighting and was typically not very aggressive, would not fight the quiet soldier until he attacked Darius first.

14
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:35,159
Darius tried to provoke him by hacking at the air close to his head with his sword.

15
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:43,474
But the soldier was not distracted. He sat quietly, as if he were dumb, and looked calmly up at the sky.

16
00:01:43,474 --> 00:01:50,030
Even when Darius nicked him on the cheek with the edge of his sword, the soldier did not move.

17
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,682
At last, he threw down his sword and shield and gave up.

18
00:01:54,682 --> 00:02:01,458
"I can't fight someone who refuses to fight me!" Darius shouted to the king. 

19
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:09,773
The king was very impressed with the soldier. Never in any battle had he seen someone so brave.

20
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:14,754
As a result, he gave the peaceful soldier amnesty.

21
00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:23,911
The soldier's actions proved to the king and everyone in the arena that peace was more powerful than fighting.
