Globalization

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:12,839
Today, it is not at all abnormal for the goods you purchase to come from around the world.

3
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:19,147
Sometimes, a single item is comprised of parts constructed in many different countries.

4
00:00:19,147 --> 00:00:23,381
This is applicable to almost anything you can buy today.

5
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:34,554
Consider a sweater -- the wool may be woven by a robot in China, dyed using artificial colors from India, and sold in the United States.

6
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:41,086
Long ago, the fiscal cost of importing or exporting items from foreign countries was high,

7
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:46,132
and manufacturers considered the practice to be fiscally irresponsible.

8
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:53,250
By contrast, prices were low for goods that were made at home or in adjacent countries.

9
00:00:53,250 --> 00:01:01,314
Nowadays, however, the convenience of importing and exporting goods is in large part due to globalization.

10
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:05,999
Globalization means more closely-connected countries.

11
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:16,406
Merchants broker deals between entrepreneurs from across the globe to consolidate their costs and configure the lowest prices for their products.

12
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:22,172
Imagine your company wants to start manufacturing bicycles and selling them.

13
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:32,985
If a factory close to home did everything, it would be expensive -- a bureaucracy would need to approve every decision, and its members would need to be paid.

14
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:43,031
Some workers would be hired to mine the aluminum and others to find the rubber; then others would build the bikes and market them to local stores.

15
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:52,942
However, dividing the tasks evenly between different countries in order to deduct or minimize certain costs makes a lot more sense.

16
00:01:52,942 --> 00:02:00,105
Paying for metal mined in Brazil and shaped in the Philippines can save manufacturing costs.

17
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:10,917
Building the bikes in China, where prices are low, and selling them to Japan, where prices are high, can help a business owner make higher profits.

18
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:17,179
The consensus among many traders is that globalization has helped them become wealthy.

19
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:27,631
Globalization, however, has its negative side as well, as local workers sometimes lose out to absent laborers in distant lands.

20
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:33,127
For this reason, many commentators deem globalization as something negative;

21
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:41,597
the ideological differences between supporters of globalization may clash with politicians who pass laws that try to limit it.

22
00:02:41,597 --> 00:02:46,958
Yet despite critiques, globalization continues to grow stronger.

23
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:57,635
United States' franchises like McDonalds, for example, can be found around the world, and almost all machines have parts that are made in China.
