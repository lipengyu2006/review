The Brute and the Billionaire

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:15,310
Hundreds of people had come to see a popular satire, but during the performance a fire started in the theater.

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:23,746
The audience and actors evacuated the building. Luckily, no one was hurt, and the fire was soon put out.

4
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:30,947
Immediately, the audience assembled into an angry mob and demanded to know what had happened.

5
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:39,383
It was soon revealed that the fire had started backstage, and only two people were in the area at the time.

6
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:45,384
One was the husband of the play's star actress, the billionaire Henry Rich.

7
00:00:45,384 --> 00:00:53,093
The other was the theater's janitor, Bil, a large and strong man who looked like a brute.

8
00:00:53,093 --> 00:00:58,584
The crowd segregated the two men and demanded to know who the culprit was.

9
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:02,221
Most of the crowd thought that Bill was to blame.

10
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:08,221
They felt that he had started the fire, without ever subjecting him to any scrutiny.

11
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:16,112
Bil resented this but said nothing. Luckily, the billionaire's wife testified in his defense.

12
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:24,403
"Your Decision is premature," she told the crowd. "I fell down amid the tumult while everyone fled the fire.

13
00:01:24,403 --> 00:01:30,949
Bil rescued me and carried me out of the building. I think you underestimate his character.

14
00:01:30,949 --> 00:01:38,731
Besides, in order to be close enough to save me, he couldn't have been near the place where the fire began."

15
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:46,041
The crowd then turned their eyes to the billionaire. "He did it!" they shouted. "Make him pay!"

16
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:54,405
"Wait" the billionaire said over the uproar. "I admit that I started the fire, but it was an accident.

17
00:01:54,405 --> 00:02:02,405
I was going backstage to see my wife and was clumsy. I collided with a lamp, and it fell to the floor.

18
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:07,860
It fell into some flammable clothing, a fire started, and I fled."

19
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:14,478
The mob was surprised. The man they blamed was innocent, and the billionaire was guilty.

20
00:02:14,478 --> 00:02:22,806
To pay for his error, the billionaire not only repaired the theater but had it remade to be better than before.
