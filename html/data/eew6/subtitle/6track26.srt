1
00:00:02,514 --> 00:00:05,271
The Mayor of Sherman

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:11,028
The cosmopolitan city of Sherman needed to elect a new mayor.

3
00:00:11,028 --> 00:00:16,826
Two men aspired to become mayor: Mr. Jones and Mr. Webb.

4
00:00:16,826 --> 00:00:24,853
Mr. Jones was a tall, handsome man. He was a phenomenal speaker, and the citizens loved him.

5
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:30,124
However, Mr. Jones didn't know much about running a city.

6
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:35,638
He was a pathological liar who merely flattered people with his words.

7
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:41,801
Mr. Webb was very different. He was a small, unattractive man.

8
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:51,207
He was lame and limped when he walked. But he was an expert in politics and knew what was best for the people.

9
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:56,802
The citizens of Sherman didn't care about what the politicians had to say.

10
00:00:56,802 --> 00:01:02,235
No one listened to Mr. Webb even though he had great ideas.

11
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:08,478
They cheered when Mr. Jones spoke although he didn't talk about important things.

12
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,425
It was as if his pretty words put people in a trance.

13
00:01:13,425 --> 00:01:18,614
All the polls predicted that Mr. Jones would win the election.

14
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:27,696
When the votes were totaled, Mr. Jones won easily. But when he took office, he didn't know what to do!

15
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:32,237
He tried to hide his ignorance by working in secrecy.

16
00:01:32,237 --> 00:01:39,048
He added a law to the city's constitution that prevented citizens from seeing the mayor.

17
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:47,238
He even censored newspapers that tried to disseminate information about his inability to help the people.

18
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:53,441
Soon, however, Mr. Jones became infamous for his poor leadership.

19
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:57,496
There was an outburst of anger among the citizens.

20
00:01:57,496 --> 00:02:03,577
They were full of remorse for their misguided decision to elect an ignorant mayor.

21
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:08,969
They voted to remove Mr. Jones and let Mr. Webb take over.

22
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:14,078
Immediately, Mr. Webb proved that he was a great mayor.

23
00:02:14,078 --> 00:02:20,159
He abolished Mr. Jones's law, and he was willing to talk openly with everyone.

24
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:26,241
He tackled important issues and amended unfair laws in the city's charter.

25
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:33,012
The citizens learned that a pleasant appearance and nice words do not make a good leader.

26
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:39,620
The most important qualities are intelligence and a desire to help others.
