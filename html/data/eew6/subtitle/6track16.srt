Jen's New Job

2
00:00:03,427 --> 00:00:08,318
The history museum needed to recruit a new tour guide.

3
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:13,638
The director interviewed dozens of applicants before he decided to hire Jen.

4
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:19,207
She was chosen because she was friendly, punctual, and had a great attitude.

5
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:24,634
On her first day, Jen got to work and prepared to give her first tour.

6
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:27,419
She looked at the names on the register.

7
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:32,845
She saw that the Queen of England and a diplomat were visiting the museum.

8
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:37,986
She thought, "It's my very first day, and I have to impress a monarch!

9
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:42,806
I hope I don't humiliate myself in front of a person of such renown!"

10
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:52,267
Jen was nervous. She took a deep breath and said, "Hello, everyone! I'm going to talk to you about the chronology of ancient Egypt."

11
00:00:52,267 --> 00:01:01,014
As she turned around to show the group some artifacts, she bumped into a copy of a fossil of an authentic elephant tusk.

12
00:01:01,014 --> 00:01:05,834
It fell to the ground and broke into a million pieces!

13
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:14,259
"Oh no!" said Jen to herself. "I sure hope the rest of the tour goes better than this!"

14
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:23,613
The rest of the tour did not go any better. She tripped over an antique vase and broke a piece off of it.

15
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:31,182
As she was reading an excerpt from a lyric poem, she sneezed and tore a page of the epic.

16
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:36,109
After the tour, Jen approached the queen to apologize.

17
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:45,641
She said, "I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I was a terrible tour guide. Let me give you a refund for the money you spent."

18
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:54,798
The Queen laughed and said, "I didn't pay so there is no need for a refund, Jen. I loved the tour.

19
00:01:54,798 --> 00:02:04,099
You just have to be a little more careful and work hard to become the best at your job. Hard work precedes success."

20
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:11,364
Jen smiled and thanked the Queen. She decided to be extra careful from then on.

21
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:19,879
She was persistent and worked hard. In time, Jen became the best tour guide at the museum.
