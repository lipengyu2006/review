The Big Ship

2
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:15,543
Ernest looked at his fleet of ships. Usually, he used them for his firm, which imported marble statues from other countries.

3
00:00:15,543 --> 00:00:21,150
But today he was going fishing, and the ship he chose was his favorite.

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,828
It had an elaborate painting on the side that showed a naval battle.

5
00:00:25,828 --> 00:00:30,081
It also had some new updates to its computer system.

6
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:38,046
His favorite ship's latest acquisition was a device with a small grid to show the ship's exact location.

7
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:47,828
This new accessory kept Ernest from getting lost. At daybreak, Ernest happily sailed until he was far from land.

8
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:58,190
Then he saw a small boat in the distance. There was an old man standing next to its mast. He was waving his arms in the air.

9
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,333
There was also a boy with his head hanging over the boat's edge.

10
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:07,508
Ernest inferred that the boy was suffering from nausea.

11
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:14,816
Their clothes were saturated with seawater. Ernest assumed that they were in trouble.

12
00:01:14,816 --> 00:01:21,389
Most people never realized, but Ernest had an innate desire to help people.

13
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:29,045
He began sailing toward them, eager to facilitate their rescue and thus solve their dilemma.

14
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:34,071
As he got closer to the boat, he was shocked by its simplicity.

15
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:40,335
The boat's wood looked no stronger than cardboard, and the equipment was old.

16
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:48,609
Still, there were several large fish in a pouch in the boat. Ernest threw a large package onto the boat.

17
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:54,215
He yelled, "Here! You can inflate this boat to get you back to land."

18
00:01:54,215 --> 00:02:04,384
"Get out of here!" screamed the old man. Ernest was confused. "Don't you need help?" he asked.

19
00:02:04,384 --> 00:02:09,797
"Your ship doesn't seem adequate enough to sail so far away from land."

20
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:18,961
"You've just scared away a huge fish," the boy said. "We waved to let you know you were too close to us."

21
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:27,428
Ernest turned around and headed home. He learned that it's better not to help unless asked to.

22
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:32,145
Otherwise, you might not help anyone at all.
