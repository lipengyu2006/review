The Coward's Lesson

2
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:13,794
Tom was easily frightened. He enlisted in the army because he thought the military would teach him courage.

3
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:19,305
And although he needed courage, he never imagined how he would learn it.

4
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:29,606
During a march across a tract of wilderness to practice guerilla warfare near his country's frontier, Tom strayed from his squad.

5
00:00:29,606 --> 00:00:37,566
He had stopped to gaze at a splendid view of a lush valley. When he turned around, his squad was gone.

6
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:43,905
He searched for them, but because their outfits had camouflage, he couldn't find them.

7
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:51,036
It was getting dark, and Tom grew weary. All he had was a knife and his handbook.

8
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:59,572
He made camp for the night. It was cold, and the ground was hard. He wished he had his cot and a blanket.

9
00:00:59,572 --> 00:01:06,559
Instead, he made a fire, wrapped himself tightly in his jacket, and fell a sleep.

10
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:14,807
A loud noise roused him from his sleep. "What was that?" he wondered, Then he noticed it.

11
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:20,678
An animal of substantial size had left a print from its paw in the dirt.

12
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:25,216
He sat closer to the fire and looked into the darkness.

13
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:32,455
He imagined a large beast jumping from the gloom and attacking him. He shook with fear.

14
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:38,434
Tom contemplated many different plans. He was hesitant to act.

15
00:01:38,434 --> 00:01:45,494
He decided to stay by the fire, but during his vigil, he heard more noises.

16
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:49,203
He couldn't contend with his fear any longer.

17
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:54,930
He knew what he had to do. He made a torch and followed the prints.

18
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,801
He heard a twig snap very close ahead, but he bravely went on.

19
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:04,835
Seconds later, he discovered what had scared him.

20
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:10,453
It was only a sheep. Tom went back to his camp and slept.

21
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:15,748
In the morning, he found his squad. He had finally learned courage.

22
00:02:15,748 --> 00:02:21,582
He learned that he had to confront his fear in order to conquer it.
