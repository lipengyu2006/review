Cosmo's Flight

2
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:11,811
When Cosmo woke up, he was crying. He had had a dream that he was falling.

3
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:15,956
This dream had recurred for the previous five nights.

4
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:23,623
Cosmo was scared that his dreams were a preview of what was going to happen on his flight the next day.

5
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:30,005
Cosmo was a supernatural being who was about to turn 15 years old.

6
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:36,802
In his culture, boys of his age were required to participate in an important rite.

7
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:46,210
They were given wings and instructed to orbit the Earth. After successful flights, the boys officially became men.

8
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:54,996
Cosmo certainly wanted to be a man, but he was scared. He went to the oracle of a god named Dano.

9
00:00:54,996 --> 00:01:01,337
Cosmo said, "I'm not sure I can make such a long trip. What if I get tired?

10
00:01:01,337 --> 00:01:11,200
What if my strength stalls, and I can't stay in the air. I'll crash and die!" Dano replied, "Don't be afraid.

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,500
You have all the relevant skills in your personal inventory that have been building up over the years.

12
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,805
To ease your worry, let me tell you a little about what will happen tomorrow.

13
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:29,311
You'll begin over Africa. You'll keep flying north until you come to the Himalayas.

14
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:34,906
The mountaintops will look like small loaves of bread at such a high distance.

15
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:40,916
The rivers of the world will look like pieces of blue string that cross the globe.

16
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:46,635
Keep your body horizontal when flying against the winds of the Pacific Ocean.

17
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:53,970
Keep your eyes open and enjoy the beauty of the Earth. You will be fine, you'll see."

18
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,974
Cosmo replied, "Thanks for the overview of my journey. I'll do my best."

19
00:02:00,974 --> 00:02:07,813
The next morning, Cosmo was provided with a divine set of wings and sent on his way.

20
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:15,645
He flapped his wings and went high above the Earth. He flew over mountains, oceans, and glaciers.

21
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:20,909
After a while, his inward thoughts were no longer about falling.

22
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:27,125
He was actually having fun! He began to hum a song as he enjoyed the view.

23
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:31,145
When he reached home, his tribe was there to greet him.

24
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:38,854
The chief said, "On behalf of the tribe, I declare you a man. We're proud of you, Cosmo!"

25
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:42,957
Cosmo was proud of himself, too.
