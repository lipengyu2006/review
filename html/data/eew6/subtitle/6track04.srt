The Helpful Abbey

2
00:00:05,446 --> 00:00:13,902
It had not rained on the prairie for several months. Because of the drought, the climate had become very arid.

3
00:00:13,902 --> 00:00:23,842
There was no moisture left in the soil. No crops could grow in the dry ground. By wintertime, the people had nothing to eat. 

4
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:30,850
The hungry families heard about an abbey near the mountains where food and water was still abundant.

5
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:41,400
So they traveled inland, across the prairie, to the abbey.  At first, only a few families arrived, seeking food and shelter.

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:48,484
Then there was ample food. The monks fed them and let them sleep in the small cathedral. 

7
00:00:48,484 --> 00:00:58,958
Soon, however, more families were arriving every day. These people had to travel farther, so they were in worse condition.

8
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:09,089
The rugged journey had brought them to the edge of a crisis. They were cold and tired. The tiny cathedral was soon full. 

9
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:18,153
Food became scarce. The monks began to grumble. They began to speculate that there would be no food.

10
00:01:18,153 --> 00:01:27,751
"If more families come, we won't make it through the winter," said a young monk. "We must ask some of them to leave."

11
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:37,273
The abbot heard this. "We cannot do that," he said. "It would be wrong to deprive them of food and shelter.

12
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:47,480
We took an oath to help those that need help. All here are in need, so all are eligible to receive our food and shelter."

13
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:59,972
"But we won't have enough," the monk said. "That might be true, but we must help them nonetheless. We will fast," the abbot replied.

14
00:01:59,972 --> 00:02:10,218
"Also, we will give our rooms in the abbey to those sleeping outside, and we will sleep in the churchyard that adjoins the cathedral." 

15
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:16,273
The monks were reluctant at first, but they did what the oldest monk said.

16
00:02:16,273 --> 00:02:22,063
By the end of winter, there was still enough food and shelter for everyone.

17
00:02:22,063 --> 00:02:30,099
They learned that sometimes helping others means you must give more help than you first expected.
