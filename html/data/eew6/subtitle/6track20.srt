The Avalanche

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:13,045
Randy was a forest ranger. Because of his job, he was often secluded in a cabin in the wilderness.

3
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:21,300
One day, the radio reported, "A change in the atmosphere is causing a lot of clouds to form. A serious storm..."

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:30,413
Suddenly, the radio went silent. The signal was lost. He went outside and looked at the overcast sky.

5
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:37,811
Anybody else would have taken the dark sky as an omen of a very bad storm, but not Randy.

6
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:45,249
His upbringing had taught him consistency. He had done this job for years, and nothing could stop him.

7
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:52,531
Besides, he thought nothing could hurt him. Today, he had a very important task to do.

8
00:00:52,531 --> 00:01:00,475
The snow was starting to pile up high on the mountain. If too much accumulated, it could cause an avalanche.

9
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:10,716
But Randy had an apparatus to get rid of the snow. It used dynamite to shake the snow and make the top layer of snow come down.

10
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:19,322
As the snow started falling, he thought about returning to the office until the storm stopped, but he decided not to.

11
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:24,715
Suddenly, he heard a loud noise behind him. It was an avalanche! 

12
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:34,665
He started to run, but within seconds, he was knocked sideways and buried by the snow and rubble from an old cabin that had been destroyed.

13
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:37,819
An aerial rescue team came quickly.

14
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:47,203
Randy was just a speck amongst the great pile of snow, but the team found him thanks to his brightly colored jacket.

15
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:54,524
They quickly took him to a hospital. After a few hours, Randy woke up in the hospital.

16
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:59,742
He looked at the sober faces of the doctors and saw his wife sobbing.

17
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:09,516
"What's wrong?" he asked. He didn't remember what had happened. "You were almost killed!" his wife said.

18
00:02:09,516 --> 00:02:19,096
"You broke several ribs. But the rest of you is still reasonably intact. You are really lucky to be alive," the doctor said.

19
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:24,197
After five days, Randy was discharged from the hospital.

20
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:33,309
The episode had taught him a poignant lesson: he was a mortal, and nature was much more powerful than him.
