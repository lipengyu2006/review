00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,099
Small World

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:11,375
Even though people can't see me, I'm an important part of Earth's biosphere.

3
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:17,499
Scientists who study ecology know that I was the first life form on Earth.

4
00:00:17,499 --> 00:00:22,749
There are more of my kind than any other plant or animal in the world.

5
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:27,964
Without me, other plants and animals would not even exist.

6
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:34,474
I am a protist, and my tiny body is made up of one single cell.

7
00:00:34,474 --> 00:00:39,828
In my small world, things can be absolutely bizarre.

8
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:45,393
Unlike most aquatic plants and animals, I don't need a temperate climate.

9
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:49,628
I have a very high tolerance for extreme conditions.

10
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:54,388
Right now, I'm swimming around in a bucket of boiling water!

11
00:00:54,388 --> 00:01:00,128
The temperature is 150 degrees Celsius, but I feel comfortable.

12
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:05,727
I have coarse hairs called cilia that help me swim around in here.

13
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:10,977
I move my cilia in a repetitive motion for the duration of my swim.

14
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:18,852
I cannot go very fast, though. It takes me about five minutes to swim a distance of just one millimeter! 

15
00:01:18,852 --> 00:01:27,636
When I get hungry, I look for tiny, vulnerable parasites. I swim up to one and swallow it whole.

16
00:01:27,636 --> 00:01:35,266
I digest things much like people do. I have an organ that works just like a human stomach.

17
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:43,456
After I eat, I release nitrogen gas. Nitrogen is a prominent gas in the Earth's atmosphere.

18
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:52,345
Other plants and animals need my nitrogen to survive. My reproductive ability is my most unique trait.

19
00:01:52,345 --> 00:02:02,495
I don't need a companion to mate with. Instead, I undergo a process called fission, where my own nucleus splits in half.

20
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:11,035
An exact copy of my nucleus is made, which forms into another protist. It really is an impressive feat.

21
00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:17,544
I can create an infinite number of new protists all by myself!
