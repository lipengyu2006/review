The Persistent Inventor

2
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:11,901
A young student of meteorology was having a difficult time with an experiment.

3
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:19,894
He was attempting to duplicate lightning in clouds. He had made a device that could simulate lightning.

4
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:25,080
It worked by releasing an electromagnetic pulse into the cloud.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,693
This pulse, in turn, stimulated the electrons in the cloud's particles.

6
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:38,757
Then, the electrons produced lightning. But his meteorological experiment had a major defect.

7
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:45,649
He couldn't get the device into the sky. He had tied it to balloons, but they had burst.

8
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:51,581
He had shot the device from a cannon, but the force of the cannon had damaged it.

9
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:57,940
"You should give up," his friends told him. "You'll never get that thing into the air."

10
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,771
But his friends' criticisms only spurred him to try again.

11
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:09,734
The student was very innovative, and at last, he thought that he had an innovation that would work.

12
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:20,889
He attached wings to the device, and on one dreary day, when clouds blocked the light of the sun, he started his experiment anew.

13
00:01:20,889 --> 00:01:26,004
He placed the device on a rocket and launched it into the sky.

14
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:31,368
The propulsion of the rocket carried the device high into the air.

15
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:37,088
The rocket accelerated into the clouds and then released the device.

16
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:47,638
It glided on its wings through the clouds, and when it penetrated the center of a large black cloud, it emitted the electromagnetic pulse.

17
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:52,612
And just as he had predicted, lightning shot from the cloud!

18
00:01:52,612 --> 00:02:01,315
He called his professors, and the next day, they came to watch. He successfully duplicated the experiment.

19
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:08,242
His teachers were extremely impressed and called the student and his invention ingenious.

20
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:13,464
The student was given many awards and became a famous inventor.

21
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:19,539
He had not given up. He had remained persistent and succeeded.
