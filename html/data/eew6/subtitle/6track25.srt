The Nurse's Lesson

2
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:09,064
One of the children in the nursery was sick.

3
00:00:09,064 --> 00:00:15,003
The child's mother, who usually chattered constantly, was quiet and worried.

4
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:21,185
She knew that if she did not act quickly, the child's condition would deteriorate.

5
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:24,797
She summoned the children's nurse and said to her,

6
00:00:24,797 --> 00:00:32,889
"The monks make a medicine that can cure my child's sickness. Please, hurry tonight to the monastery and get it."

7
00:00:32,889 --> 00:00:36,952
The nurse immediately hurried from the manor to get the medicine.

8
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:43,064
The monastery was far away, and she had to walk along a dark and winding trail.

9
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:48,517
The temperature was close to zero degrees centigrade, and it was raining.

10
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:52,337
Luckily, the nurse had grabbed her raincoat beforehand.

11
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:59,352
She zipped it up and pulled the hood over her head. "I'll never make it there," she thought.

12
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:07,201
"Perhaps I should return and go in the morning." But she remembered the sick child and decided to continue.

13
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:13,522
She could see the gleam of a light in the distance, and finally, she arrived at the monastery.

14
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:18,488
It was very late. She feared the monks would not be hospitable.

15
00:01:18,488 --> 00:01:26,409
But she approached the door and knocked anyway. The rain had condensed on the exterior of the windows by the door.

16
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:32,449
All she could see was the blurred profile of a large man coming to answer the door.

17
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:39,673
Again, she was filled with fear. But the monk smiled at her with good humor when he opened the door.

18
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:44,257
He took her outstretched hand and welcomed her with a hearty voice.

19
00:01:44,257 --> 00:01:50,856
The place was warm, and she heard a concerto playing in another room. She relaxed.

20
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:56,551
"How can I help you?" the monk asked, and the nurse explained the situation.

21
00:01:56,551 --> 00:02:03,601
He instantly knew what to do. He grabbed a parcel of medicine and took her back to the manor in a carriage.

22
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:10,651
The medicine worked. The nurse was happy she had kept going through the bad weather and found the monastery.

23
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:16,555
Now the boy would be able to get better, and the mother would be happy again.
