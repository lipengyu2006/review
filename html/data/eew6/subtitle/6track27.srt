The Editor's Choice

2
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:12,667
A newspaper editor sat at his desk and stared at the flashing cursor on his computer's screen.

3
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:18,739
He didn't know if he should delete the article he had just written or go ahead and publish it.

4
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:29,273
He was scared and filled with doubt. The empire had passed a new law stating that citizens could only use the imperial language.

5
00:00:29,273 --> 00:00:35,574
The editor disagreed with the law and decided to write an article about why it was wrong.

6
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:42,466
He felt that the new law excluded people of different nationalities, and racial and ethnic backgrounds.

7
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:51,917
He had firsthand knowledge of what it felt like not to be fluent in the imperial language because he was from a remote part of the empire.

8
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:57,397
He felt that the empire shouldn't be monolingual and should be more inclusive.

9
00:00:57,397 --> 00:01:02,648
Yet, he was afraid that he would get in trouble for having this belief.

10
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:07,965
Many would say that he was not a patriot -- that he didn't love the empire.

11
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:12,001
But he didn't wish to undermine the authority of the empire.

12
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:19,221
He wanted to argue that the empire could be stronger if it accepted people of various cultures and beliefs.

13
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:25,423
At last, he decided to stop being a coward and to be earnest about how he felt.

14
00:01:25,423 --> 00:01:33,004
He wrote the article. It wasn't rude or angry, but rather, very solemn and intelligent.

15
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:36,877
The next day, it was published in all the papers.

16
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:42,849
Everyone was impressed by his tact and showed solidarity with his ideas.

17
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:48,035
He expected to be arrested any day, but the police never came.

18
00:01:48,035 --> 00:01:53,187
Surprisingly, instead of being prosecuted, he became a hero.

19
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:59,291
The legislature changed the law, and people from many linguistic backgrounds praised him.

20
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:03,426
"Never be afraid to be vocal," the editor later wrote.

21
00:02:03,426 --> 00:02:08,874
"If you think something is wrong, then stand up for what you believe."
