1
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:04,866
Watch Out!

2
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:12,049
Kevin stepped off the tram and walked toward the ship, holding a package tightly in his hands.

3
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:16,104
He had been hired as a courier for an important broker.

4
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:23,635
All he needed to do was deliver a package to an office in New York City; the ship would take him there.

5
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:27,767
When he boarded, the ship was congested with people.

6
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:33,791
As Kevin walked to his cabin, he saw the exclusive first-class section.

7
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:37,653
Everybody inside was wearing fancy garments.

8
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:44,334
He would have liked to socialize with the people inside, but it was against proper etiquette.

9
00:00:44,334 --> 00:00:49,509
People paid a premium for the privilege to ride in first-class.

10
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:54,645
Instead, he went to his cabin next to the freight section of the boat.

11
00:00:54,645 --> 00:01:01,172
His room smelled bad, and the floorboards were warped and deformed in some areas.

12
00:01:01,172 --> 00:01:06,347
He could also hear the motor humming as it waited to propel the ship forward.

13
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:12,642
Suddenly, Kevin was unsettled by something, but he wasn't sure why.

14
00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:18,550
He took a short walk on the ship's deck, but he still felt strange.

15
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:26,892
That night, he suffered from insomnia -- he couldn't suppress his obsessing over how strange he felt.

16
00:01:26,892 --> 00:01:31,990
Kevin went back on deck. It was cold and dark outside.

17
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:37,165
He looked overboard, but it seemed that everything was all right.

18
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:42,339
"Just go back inside," he thought. Then Kevin saw it.

19
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:47,167
A giant iceberg was sticking out of the ocean in the distance!

20
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:57,632
"Help!" he yelled. People looked at him as if he was crazy, but he continued to shout until he saw the captain.

21
00:01:57,632 --> 00:02:01,610
"There's an iceberg out there," Kevin said to him.

22
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:08,832
"If the ship doesn't move, we're liable to crash," he said, pointing toward the iceberg.

23
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:15,204
The captain saw it and immediately instructed the crew to change the ship's direction.

24
00:02:15,204 --> 00:02:24,241
"Without your help, we would have definitely hit the iceberg. That would have been a terrible disaster!" he said to Kevin. 

25
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:31,733
Kevin felt relieved. Now he knew to always trust his intuitive sense.
