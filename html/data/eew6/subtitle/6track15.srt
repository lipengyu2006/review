The Lottery

2
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:09,561
Joe was watching television when he heard a knock at the door.

3
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:15,772
He thought, "Who could that be? It's probably one of the naughty neighborhood children."

4
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:22,053
Joe stood up and walked to the door. When he opened it, he saw a beautiful woman.

5
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:26,519
She said, "Good morning, Joe! I have great news.

6
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,695
You're the recipient of this check for one million dollars! You won the lottery!"

7
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:41,523
Joe couldn't believe it. His mind was overloaded with emotions. Joe said, "Thank you! Thank you!"

8
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:48,816
After he calmed down, Joe made a photocopy of the check in case he misplaced the original one.

9
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:56,562
He sat and thought about what he wanted to do with the money. He didn't want to spend it in an arbitrary way.

10
00:00:56,562 --> 00:01:01,831
Joe thought, "I know there are others who need this money more than I do.

11
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:07,414
I've always loved animals, so I think I'll buy things for the zoo!"

12
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:16,207
Joe knew that the zoo was in bad shape. The cages were too small, and they weren't insulated from the cold.

13
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:23,674
Animals couldn't thrive in such conditions. He took out some stationery and wrote a letter to the zoo.

14
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:28,978
He offered to help the zoo buy huge cages for the large mammals and reptiles.

15
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:34,247
He offered to buy healthy food for the orangutans to increase their longevity.

16
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:40,947
He even said that he would buy new glass walls for the aquarium because the old ones were cracked.

17
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:45,274
Joe's act of philanthropy intrigued the zookeeper.

18
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:52,252
He decided to probe into Joe's motivations to learn why he spent his money to improve the Zoo.

19
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:57,137
It wasn't a social convention for a person to be so gracious.

20
00:01:57,137 --> 00:02:08,792
Joe told the zookeeper, "I know it's not the norm, but my ultimate decision to help these animals is better than anything I could have done for myself.

21
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:17,027
If I ever write an autobiography, I will write that this was the happiest day of my life."
