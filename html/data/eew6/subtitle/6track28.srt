The Kidnapping

2
00:00:05,045 --> 00:00:11,890
Anne was a very quiet girl who had an inherent fear of almost everything.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,231
The kids at school would play tricks on her all the time.

4
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:23,076
They would hide behind the door of the school janitor's closet, then jump out to scare her.

5
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:29,294
Once, a boy dressed up like a vampire and chased her down the street.

6
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:35,982
Anne hated being constrained by her fears, but she didn't know how to be brave

7
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:42,006
She was walking home from school one day when someone came up behind her.

8
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:46,816
Before she could turn around, a powerful man grabbed her.

9
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:52,448
She couldn't scream because a huge hand was put over her mouth.

10
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:58,002
Anne knew that this could not be another stunt by her classmates.

11
00:00:58,002 --> 00:01:04,182
The scary man restrained her arms and legs, and carried her to his house.

12
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:11,613
He tied Anne to a chair. Her guts began to hurt because she was so scared.

13
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:15,876
The man prodded Anne with his forefinger and said,

14
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:22,290
"You'll stay right here until I get a ransom from your parents. Then I'll be rich!"

15
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:29,761
The dirty man spit when he talked. A string of saliva hung from his moist lips.

16
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:38,639
Anne was terrified and intimidated by the horrible man. But she knew she had to escape somehow.

17
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:45,483
Eventually, the man yawned. Anne waited quietly until he fell asleep.

18
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:52,641
As he slept, she carefully wiggled her arms and legs until the ropes became loose.

19
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:57,373
She slipped out of the ropes and carefully opened the door.

20
00:01:57,373 --> 00:02:03,123
She sprinted to the bus depot and boarded a bus to the police station.

21
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:08,325
She told the police what happened, and they arrested the kidnapper.

22
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:15,443
The kids at school were amazed. They asked her, "Weren't you too scared to escape?"

23
00:02:15,443 --> 00:02:21,388
She said, "Nope. I knew that I had to be brave and get out of there!"

24
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:25,768
The kids were very tolerant of Anne from then on.

25
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:33,864
They even decided that they would emulate her bravery if they ever got into a tough situation.
