The First Organ Transplant

2
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:11,409
In 1954, a man named Richard was dying of kidney disease.

3
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:16,088
He wouldn't survive for long unless he got a new kidney right away.

4
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:22,206
Richard's twin brother, Ronald, was willing to donate one of his kidneys to his dying brother.

5
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:28,757
At the time, however, no doctor had ever performed a successful internal organ transplant.

6
00:00:28,757 --> 00:00:35,163
The idea of taking an organ out of one person and putting it into another was just a fantasy.

7
00:00:35,163 --> 00:00:41,749
But the brothers decided to be brave and found a doctor who could make organ transplants a reality.

8
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:46,464
Since Richard and Ronald were twins, their heredity was identical.

9
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:49,523
They had the exact same biological traits.

10
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:52,978
Even their kidneys were identical at the cellular level.

11
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:58,557
Therefore, Ronald's working kidney could be substituted for Richard's bad one.

12
00:00:58,557 --> 00:01:03,955
Richard's body could adapt to the new organ if the operation was done correctly.

13
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:09,390
The twins went to Dr. Murray, who was a pioneer of new surgical methods.

14
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,097
His dynamic team of surgeons performed the transplant.

15
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:20,295
Dr. Murray made sure his surgeons followed a rigid sequence of directions so that no mistakes were made.

16
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:25,694
First, they made a minimal cut in Richard's side and removed the bad kidney.

17
00:01:25,694 --> 00:01:32,964
Then, they made another small cut in Ronald's side, removed his kidney, and transferred it into Richard's body.

18
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:36,275
Finally, they sewed up the respective cuts.

19
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:39,766
The entire operation only took about one hour.

20
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:44,877
After the surgery, it was clear that both brothers were going to be OK.

21
00:01:44,877 --> 00:01:47,972
The operation was confirmed a success.

22
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:50,599
Richard's new kidney worked great!

23
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:54,738
Doctors prescribed medicine for the pain caused by the surgery.

24
00:01:54,738 --> 00:01:59,921
Since Richard was still weak, he used physical therapy to rebuild his strength.

25
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:05,319
At last, Richard's transition into a healthy, happy person was complete.

26
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,810
Dr. Murray became a hero in the medical world.

27
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,173
His success gave other doctors confidence to try organ transplants themselves.

28
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:20,939
Now, doctors perform similar life-saving transplants and surgeries every day.
