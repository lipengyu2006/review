A Famous Accident

2
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:09,308
One of the greatest medical discoveries happened by accident.

3
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:15,114
In his haste to go on vacation, Alexander Fleming had left his laboratory in a mess.

4
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:19,228
The essence of his ongoing work involved a type of bacteria.

5
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:25,005
An infection caused by the bacteria was often terminal, and he was looking for a remedy.

6
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:28,098
He had left the bacteria out while he was away.

7
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:32,708
When he returned from vacation, he found that his lab was covered in fungus.

8
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:38,660
He started cleaning up the mess.
While he was cleaning, he had an impulse to examine the fungus.

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:44,437
He saw that whenever the fungus was in close proximity to the bacteria, the bacteria died.

10
00:00:44,437 --> 00:00:48,726
Although he was a messy scientist, his experiments were precise.

11
00:00:48,726 --> 00:00:52,403
He thought that there might be some significance to the fungus.

12
00:00:52,403 --> 00:00:56,867
He immediately commenced an experiment to assess what had happened to the bacteria.

13
00:00:56,867 --> 00:01:00,631
It had either died by accident or the fungus had killed it.

14
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:04,482
The subsequent tests proved it was the latter reason.

15
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:10,551
What he found astonished him.
The fungus actually inhibited the growth of the bad bacteria.

16
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:15,453
All this time, he had been looking for a synthetic material to kill the bacteria.

17
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:18,750
Instead, a common fungus did the job.

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,164
He knew that something in the fungus had killed the bacteria.

19
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:25,548
His next step was to find those molecules that had done it.

20
00:01:25,548 --> 00:01:29,283
When he found them, he extracted them and put them into a pill.

21
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:31,763
The drug proved to be very effective.

22
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:35,323
It also worked against other types of harmful bacteria.

23
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:38,182
The discovery received a lot of publicity.

24
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:41,975
Soon after, the new drug was being used all over the world.

25
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:47,869
Because of the success, the scientist was able to develop even more fabulous drugs to help people.

26
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:53,909
His accidental discovery changed the world and helped save many people's lives.
