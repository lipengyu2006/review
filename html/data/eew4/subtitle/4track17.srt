00:00:02,098 --> 00:00:04,975
The resourceful Landlord

2
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:09,711
A kind landlord was afraid that he would lose his apartment building.

3
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:16,305
He needed to make some mandatory repairs to the old building or his tenants would have to leave by the end of the month.

4
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:21,131
Without tenants to lease the rooms, the landlord would be unable to pay his mortgage.

5
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:24,547
He'd be bankrupt, and the bank would take his building.

6
00:00:24,547 --> 00:00:31,291
He got quotes for the repairs, but he didn't have the money whereby he could employ the personnel needed to make them.

7
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:36,776
It would seem like he did not want to conform to the city's codes before the forthcoming inspection.

8
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:41,122
He had requested an extension, but it was denied by the city.

9
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:45,678
He held a meeting with his tenants and explained the unfortunate situation.

10
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:52,901
"If the building does not meet the appropriate standards for safety and hygiene," he said, "the city will expel everyone."

11
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:56,558
The tenants were all sad for the kind old man.

12
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,144
"Maybe we can help," said the hairdresser who lived on the first floor.

13
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,032
The other tenants agreed.

14
00:01:03,032 --> 00:01:05,880
One tenant had worked for the city's utilities.

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,177
He knew a lot about plumbing, so that's how he helped.

16
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:13,942
Another tenant was a carpenter; he mended the holes in the floor and walls.

17
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:18,108
Others cleaned the building from top to bottom so that it was more hygienic.

18
00:01:18,108 --> 00:01:22,904
They even furnished some of the apartments with new beds, dressers, and chairs.

19
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:28,689
When they were done, all of the people went into their apartment, and the landlord went home to rest.

20
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:33,754
When the deadline of the inspection arrived, the apartment building was hygienic and safe.

21
00:01:33,754 --> 00:01:35,852
The landlord couldn't believe it.

22
00:01:35,852 --> 00:01:39,778
His old building now looked like one of the nicest buildings in town.

23
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:44,994
The building passed its inspection, and the landlord and the tenants had a big party.

24
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:49,160
"Thank you all so much," the landlord said during the party.

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,468
"I could never have done it by myself.

26
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:56,893
But by working together, we now all have a beautiful place to live."
