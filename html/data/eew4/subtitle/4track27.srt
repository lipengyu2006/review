Seizures Then and Now

2
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:13,926
If a person who lived 200 years ago was treated for a seizure today, they would be surprised by the treatment's novelty.

3
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:20,741
That's because doctors in the 1800s were influenced more by very old medical beliefs than by science.

4
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:27,894
Rather than thinking the brain caused seizures, people in the 1800s still thought they were the result of strange forces.

5
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:33,778
This belief was founded on an ideology that equated seizures with the work of evil spirits.

6
00:00:33,778 --> 00:00:37,762
Others felt that the seizures had a cosmic or lunar cause.

7
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:42,667
They believed that the cycles of the moon and planets could make someone have a seizure.

8
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:49,976
During a session to treat a patient who had seizures, doctors would force the patient to invoke the grace of the Almighty.

9
00:00:49,976 --> 00:00:56,495
They thought if the patient did this, then the patient would rid themselves of the evil spirits causing the seizures.

10
00:00:56,495 --> 00:01:00,808
The advent of modern psychiatry occurred during the 1800s.

11
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:05,746
At that time, people who suffered from seizures were placed in psychiatric hospitals.

12
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:11,310
They were treated like they were insane. However, none of the outmoded treatments worked.

13
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,347
It wasn't until the late 1850s that the causes of seizures were understood.

14
00:01:16,347 --> 00:01:19,837
We know today that these causes involve the brain.

15
00:01:19,837 --> 00:01:24,117
Misfired signals from the brain cause a jerking reflex in the body.

16
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:27,541
These usually occur when someone is very tired.

17
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:32,249
Once the causes of seizures were known, definitive treatments were developed.

18
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:36,265
Today, treatments range from taking pills to having surgery.

19
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:40,874
Treatment is personalized according to the type of seizure the patient has.

20
00:01:40,874 --> 00:01:44,463
Even today, some people are unsure about seizures.

21
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:49,730
Their most common mistake is thinking that a person having a seizure will swallow their tongue.

22
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,924
They often shove some utensil in the person's mouth.

23
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:59,805
However, this doesn't help. The utensil often blocks the airway and prevents the person from inhaling.

24
00:01:59,805 --> 00:02:03,558
Yet, most of the public no longer fear people who have seizures.

25
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:08,628
Instead, they can now help and comfort a person if they have a seizure.
