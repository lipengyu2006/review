A Day Without Sight

2
00:00:04,973 --> 00:00:09,458
On Friday afternoon, Sam's teacher had a special assignment.

3
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:18,396
"Next week, we'll be studying humanitarian efforts around the world since the time of the Renaissance, including those to help the blind," she said.

4
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:25,449
"Over the weekend, I want each of you to undertake the difficult task of wearing a blindfold for an entire day.

5
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:32,014
The premise of this experiment is that it will help you understand what it's like to be blind?" she said.

6
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:37,085
Sam was a skeptic. He really didn't think the assignment would be too challenging.

7
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:42,708
On Saturday morning, Sam took a piece of cloth and tied it around his head to cover his eyes.

8
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,405
Then he went into the kitchen for breakfast.

9
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:51,613
He heard the voices of his parents and brothers but couldn't specify where each voice was coming from.

10
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:55,351
He thought about how important hearing is for blind people.

11
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:59,089
"Could you pass me the newspaper, please?" he asked.

12
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:02,859
Just then, he remembered he couldn't see the words on the page.

13
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:06,401
He wondered if newspapers were ever made for the blind.

14
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:10,237
After finishing breakfast, his brothers asked him to play soccer.

15
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:14,559
As he followed them, he accidentally walked into the bike rack.

16
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:17,257
He also found that he couldn't play soccer.

17
00:01:17,257 --> 00:01:21,385
He wouldn't be able to coordinate his actions without being able to see.

18
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:25,155
Without his optic senses, he had no spatial awareness.

19
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:31,135
Furthermore, he couldn't easily do normal activities because he had to make sure he was safe first.

20
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:38,416
He sat on the lawn. Suddenly, he realized that, although he couldn't see, his other senses worked perfectly fine.

21
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:43,486
In fact, he began to realize new and different aspects of common objects.

22
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:47,581
For example, he took a flower bud and felt it with his finger.

23
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:51,969
He realized for the first time that it seemed to be covered with wax.

24
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:55,739
His hypothesis about being blind was disproved.

25
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,120
The informative experiment had a strong effect on him.

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:07,083
It showed him sight was an asset that should be appreciated and taught him to appreciate and give credit to the talents of blind people.
