The Ice House

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:12,382
Last year, Erik constructed one of the world's strangest houses in the icy landscape of northern Sweden.

3
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:17,772
He called it the Ice House: a house made entirely of ice and snow.

4
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:24,473
All of the beds, chairs, tables, and walls are cold, hard sculptures of ice.

5
00:00:24,473 --> 00:00:32,412
A group of architects and volunteers from all over the world traveled to the site of the Ice House and began its construction.

6
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:38,202
The multicultural group journeyed through storms and freezing temperatures to reach the site.

7
00:00:38,202 --> 00:00:46,505
Once the builders arrived, there was an interchange of ideas, tasks were assigned, and tools were allocated to each worker.

8
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:53,680
An expert was selected to oversee the building process to make sure there was no discord between the workers.

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,887
Once a plan was generated, the community of volunteers got right to work.

10
00:00:58,887 --> 00:01:04,969
The design was very unique; the builders couldn't copy the design of normal houses.

11
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:08,829
The first step was to build the walls and ceiling.

12
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:12,690
The builders used a metal frame to help them build the structure.

13
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,222
After the ice was in place, the frame was removed.

14
00:01:16,222 --> 00:01:19,755
The builders then created furniture and art pieces.

15
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:29,733
Designs were carved into each item. One worker carved big wavy lines, and another made tiny clockwise, concentric circles.

16
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:35,924
Finally, the workers carved small cavities in the roof and inserted colored lights.

17
00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:43,790
When the work was finished, the beautiful house was a visual masterpiece and was ready for a resident to enjoy.

18
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,869
Living in the Ice House is an experience like no other.

19
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:53,660
Erik stores his belongings in an ice cupboard and lays out a sleeping bag on his ice bed.

20
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,394
At dinner, he dines on a delicious salad with crisp toppings.

21
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:03,857
And for the main course, he enjoys appetizing fish caught from a nearby river.

22
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:08,227
The fish are pierced with icicles and served on ice plates.

23
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:11,650
After dinner, he gets ready for a cold night.

24
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,911
The omission of heaters can be too much for his visitors sometimes.

25
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:22,612
Luckily, there are warm rooms nearby, as a courtesy to people who get too cold.
