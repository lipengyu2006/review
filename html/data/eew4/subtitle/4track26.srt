Epidemic in Zimbabwe

2
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:12,839
In August of 2008, a deadly cholera epidemic manifested itself in Zimbabwe.

3
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:15,771
A severe health hazard caused the outbreak.

4
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:20,298
There was a lack of clean drinking water in the overcrowded urban areas.

5
00:00:20,298 --> 00:00:25,975
Garbage and chemicals got into the public water supplies and contaminated them.

6
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:32,246
Since people did not have access to other sources, they had to drink the dirty water.

7
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:37,775
The outbreak spread rapidly and infected almost 16,000 people.

8
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:41,635
The illness caused extreme pain in people's intestines.

9
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:46,756
It also caused a deficiency of important fluids in sick people's bodies.

10
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:52,359
Without the proper fluids and minerals, their bodies stopped working correctly.

11
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:58,407
People were unable to digest food properly or replenish their lost nutrients.

12
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:04,753
Without viable treatment, they would die. It was imperative to reserve the situation.

13
00:01:04,753 --> 00:01:10,059
However, the government of Zimbabwe was unable to provide help to its people.

14
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:13,881
The government didn't have a plan to stop the spread of cholera.

15
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:19,707
In addition, the country was too poor to get clean water or medication for the sick.

16
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:22,342
The people seemed to be doomed.

17
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:27,462
Luckily, many other countries recognized the need to contain the outbreak.

18
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:36,331
Dozens of voluntary practitioners from Britain, France, the United States, and other countries went to Zimbabwe to treat the disease.

19
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:43,530
Through the provision of sterile drinking water and medication, people finally got the treatment they badly needed.

20
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,872
The compassionate doctors were able to save the lives of thousands.

21
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:53,215
By January of 2009, the epidemic was almost completely contained.

22
00:01:53,215 --> 00:02:01,750
Today, the Zimbabwean government is investing in measures to avoid future epidemics and placing an emphasis on prevention.

23
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:07,279
They are cleaning up the water supply and making changes to reduce health hazards.

24
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:10,953
The system used to filter water is being upgraded.

25
00:02:10,953 --> 00:02:18,263
The government now administers the water supply plants and makes sure that they adhere to strict safety guidelines.

26
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:25,424
Hopefully, future instances of cholera will be treated before they start deadly epidemics.
