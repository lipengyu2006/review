The History of Parachutes

2
00:00:05,699 --> 00:00:12,995
Scientists who study archeology say that there may be some evidence of prehistoric parachutes.

3
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:19,565
But the first written history of the device comes from China about 2,100 years ago.

4
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:23,558
Scientists cite an ancient book that describes parachutes.

5
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:30,274
However, there is no archeological evidence that proves that an actual parachute was ever made.

6
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:36,808
Later, people from northern Africa and Italy also had ideas about a similar invention.

7
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:43,414
In fact, a Leonardo da Vinci's drawing corresponds closely with the modern parachute design!

8
00:00:43,414 --> 00:00:50,674
In 1783, French scientist Sebastian Lenormand invented the first modern parachute.

9
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:59,241
Lenormand brainstormed with a team of other scientists to come up with a way to help people jump safely out of burning buildings.

10
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:06,029
He thought the solution was to give people an object to restrict their speed while they fell toward the ground.

11
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:12,563
Many people thought that he was up to some kind of fraud, but Lenormand had a lot of integrity.

12
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:17,971
His budget was limited, so he first tested his theory by using two umbrellas.

13
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:21,928
He jumped out of a tree and found that the umbrellas worked.

14
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:28,716
Next, he refined his invention. Rather than using umbrellas, he made a large parachute.

15
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:34,887
Finally, he jumped off a tall building on a French estate and landed safely in the courtyard.

16
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:38,771
Lenormand's work gave another man an idea.

17
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:43,090
Jean-Pierre Blanchard had a different outlook than Lenormand.

18
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,559
He was a hot air balloon addict.

19
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:51,439
He was one of the first people to ride in a hot air balloon powered by hydrogen gas.

20
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,449
He was a proponent of using the parachutes to exit from hot air balloons.

21
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:05,015
Starting in 1785, he used his dog to show that animals could land safely from hot air balloons by using parachutes.

22
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:10,553
Then, in 1793, he was faced with a chaotic experience.

23
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:15,143
The hot-air balloon he was riding in burst and started to fall.

24
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:17,829
He was forced to use a parachute himself.

25
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:22,185
And much to his relief, it saved his life!
