Beethoven's Gift

2
00:00:05,265 --> 00:00:10,999
Beethoven was a great composer of classical music in the 1800s.

3
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:15,794
Many biographies have been written that narrate his dominance in the music world.

4
00:00:15,794 --> 00:00:19,114
But do you know what really makes him special?

5
00:00:19,114 --> 00:00:24,882
Even though millions of people got to hear his multiple masterpieces, he never did.

6
00:00:24,882 --> 00:00:29,744
Beethoven wrote his best pieces after he had gone completely deaf!

7
00:00:29,744 --> 00:00:34,305
His partiality toward classical music developed when he was very young.

8
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:37,390
He wasn't interested in anything else as a child.

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,643
When he was five, he learned how to play the piano.

10
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:45,807
From then on, nothing could stop his passion for writing and playing music.

11
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:49,663
When Beethoven was twenty, he began to lose his hearing.

12
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:53,151
He got acute, spontaneous pains in his ears.

13
00:00:53,151 --> 00:00:56,101
His hearing kept getting worse over time.

14
00:00:56,101 --> 00:01:00,125
It was inevitable that he would eventually lose it altogether.

15
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,412
It was very hard for him to keep writing music.

16
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:08,576
He lost the virtue of patience, and he became notorious for his aggression.

17
00:01:08,576 --> 00:01:11,594
Still, he never stopped trying.

18
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:17,261
His passion for music compelled him to keep performing even after he was deaf.

19
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:22,895
He couldn't hear himself play, but he knew that his creations sounded gorgeous.

20
00:01:22,895 --> 00:01:26,885
His final concert was held and was to be his finest.

21
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:30,641
He gave the musicians a cue, and they began to play.

22
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:33,625
He directed the concert with all his heart.

23
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:38,119
He couldn't hear the music, but he said that he could feel it.

24
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,445
Overall, the performance was one of the finest in history.

25
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:45,362
When it was over, he turned to the crowd.

26
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:47,877
They clapped and cheered wildly.

27
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:54,584
In that beautiful moment, the applause boosted his emotions, and he began to cry.

28
00:01:54,584 --> 00:01:58,977
In 1827, he suffered from lead poisoning.

29
00:01:58,977 --> 00:02:05,482
He didn't survive the sickness, but his music did because great music never dies.

30
00:02:05,482 --> 00:02:11,216
Even though Beethoven is gone, his legacy will live on forever.
