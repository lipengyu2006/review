Hundred Plays

2
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:09,768
Over two thousand years ago, Chinese farmers had a problem.

3
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:17,568
Even though they were very industrious, the weather became too cold outside to plant rice. So what did they do?

4
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:21,683
Since they had so much free time during the long, cold winters,

5
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:27,873
the inventive farmers were very resourceful and started performing tricks to entertain themselves.

6
00:00:27,873 --> 00:00:35,244
They used their farm tools and anything they could find to make their tricks more spectacular and full of energy.

7
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:41,147
They even twisted their bodies into abnormal shapes and performed awesome jumps.

8
00:00:41,147 --> 00:00:48,304
Over time, they became great acrobats, and their art form came to be known as "Hundred Plays."

9
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:51,774
Hundred Plays involves doing many kinds of tricks.

10
00:00:51,774 --> 00:00:57,678
For example, in Mandarin-speaking parts of China, performers do the lion dance.

11
00:00:57,678 --> 00:01:01,363
They wear costumes and mimic the animal's movements.

12
00:01:01,363 --> 00:01:07,482
Early performers also did tricks on ropes and vines that were high above the ground.

13
00:01:07,482 --> 00:01:15,926
Even though the acrobats' fluid movements may have looked easy, they took a lot of practice and required great technical skill.

14
00:01:15,926 --> 00:01:19,182
Learning Hundred Plays is a communal event.

15
00:01:19,182 --> 00:01:24,012
A veteran of the acrobatic arts usually teaches younger people in the village.

16
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:26,374
They spend a lot of time rehearsing.

17
00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:29,773
The young performers also learn an old philosophy.

18
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:35,713
The teachings help them harmonize the sensory aspects of acrobatics with the mental aspects.

19
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:41,366
In other words, it teaches them to use their physical and mental strength together.

20
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:47,556
Since the art has its origins with poor farmers, rich people used to scorn the acrobats.

21
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:51,850
They thought acrobats were villains who just wanted to trick them.

22
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,428
But later, their misguided opinions changed.

23
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:59,149
Acrobats came to be respected in Chinese society.

24
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:07,486
They were invited to perform in metropolitan areas as well as in small villages, and they performed for important people.

25
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:12,638
Arts advocacy groups convinced the government to support Chinese acrobatics.

26
00:02:12,638 --> 00:02:19,830
As a result, there is now a statute that made several villages the center of training future acrobats.
