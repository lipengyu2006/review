Impressionism

2
00:00:04,758 --> 00:00:09,903
Impressionism is a movement that began in France in the late 19th century.

3
00:00:09,903 --> 00:00:16,209
It is considered to be the first modern art movement, as it was seen as a departure from other art.

4
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:20,967
This is because it violated the established rules of academic painting.

5
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:28,897
Unlike realistic academic paintings, impressionist paintings are characterized by the depiction of light on objects.

6
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:35,474
The artists aim to capture the light rather than the details in order to show an impression of time.

7
00:00:35,474 --> 00:00:40,154
This distinctive quality is achieved by using two key techniques.

8
00:00:40,154 --> 00:00:43,365
The first is a technique called "impasto."

9
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:47,079
Impasto is an Italian word that means "mixture."

10
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,566
In painting, impasto describes short, thick strokes.

11
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:57,214
This technique allows the artist to control the reflection and movement of light on the canvas.

12
00:00:57,214 --> 00:01:05,531
The artist can modify the width and direction of the paint strokes to convey texture and give the painting a three-dimensional quality.

13
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:11,063
Also, the speed and strength of the strokes can convey the artist's perception of the subject.

14
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:14,197
The second technique is optical mixing.

15
00:01:14,197 --> 00:01:17,059
This involves the use of broken colors.

16
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:25,841
In other words, instead of the traditional practice of mixing an array of colors on a palette, artists paint different colors side by side.

17
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:29,129
Doing this adds texture and plays on light.

18
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:32,301
And it creates the illusion of different colors.

19
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:38,297
Another difference between impressionist paintings and traditional paintings is the subject matter.

20
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:44,100
During that time period, the accepted subjects were historical or literary-themes.

21
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,161
They were often based on religious or mythological subjects.

22
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:53,423
Impressionists, on the other hand, preferred landscapes and contemporary life.

23
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:58,219
They often painted outdoors, using the sunlight to depict a brighter style.

24
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:04,602
Even though photography was starting to become popular, impressionists avoided representing reality.

25
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:11,952
They demonstrated their individualism by playing with color and blurring the lines between the subject and the background.

26
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:16,517
In the mid-19th century, the middle class in Paris saw rapid growth.

27
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:21,198
The city saw an increase in cafÃ©s, cinemas, parks, and boutiques.

28
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:26,575
Impressionists captured the daily lives of the middle class, which appealed to the wider public,

29
00:02:26,575 --> 00:02:31,449
and eventually led to the acceptance of impressionism into the art world.
