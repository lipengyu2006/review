00:00:02,123 --> 00:00:05,420
The New Bioco

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:11,030
Jack got a new job at a biotechnology company called Bioco.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,184
Bioco manufactured drugs to treat diabetes and high cholesterol.

4
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:21,074
Jack's job was to use a tiny mechanism to get nectar from flowers.

5
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:24,296
The nectar was a main ingredient in the drugs.

6
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:29,412
Jack liked his job, and he thought that Bioco was a caring company.

7
00:00:29,412 --> 00:00:35,477
However, Jack soon learned that the company wasn't as kind as he first thought.

8
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:39,911
Bioco's motto was "Make the Earth a Better Place."

9
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:42,940
However, this motto was deceptive.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,840
The company actually did a number of really bad things to the environment.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,964
The company produced a lot of smog and harmful acid.

12
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:57,081
Bioco poured the acid in a nearby river, which killed the fish.

13
00:00:57,081 --> 00:01:01,857
The waste from the factory also caused erosion of the river banks.

14
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:08,225
After a few weeks at the new job, Jack saw all the bad things Bioco was doing.

15
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:13,417
He had always had strong ethics, and he knew he had to do something.

16
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:20,543
One day, while the Bioco workers were eating in the cafeteria, Jack stood up and gave a speech.

17
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:28,010
He said, "My fellow coworkers, I know you have all seen the evil things our company is doing.

18
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:33,013
I have a notion that we can fix them if we form a coalition.

19
00:01:33,013 --> 00:01:39,797
We can go to the administration and tell them we'll quit if they don't eliminate the problems.

20
00:01:39,797 --> 00:01:43,019
They'll have no choice but to listen to us."

21
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,900
Jack explained what they were to do.

22
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,970
His coworkers liked his explicit plan.

23
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:57,270
They went to the administrative offices and demanded that Bioco stop damaging the environment, or they all would quit.

24
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,842
One supervisor said to them, "Thank you for being straightforward about this issue.

25
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:08,698
Since I can't afford to lose all of you workers, I guess we'll just have to fix things."

26
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:16,184
Jack, his supervisor, and his coworkers spent the next month designing a new framework for the company.

27
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:22,286
They cleaned up the acid from the river and minimized the amount of air pollution the company released.

28
00:02:22,286 --> 00:02:28,654
At last, under this new regime, the company's motto was more suitable.
