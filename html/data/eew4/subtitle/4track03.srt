Le Chambon-sur-Lignon

2
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:15,003
During World War II, thousands of foreign-born and French Jews had to flee from the Nazis, who were capturing them and taking them to the death camps.

3
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:19,535
A small number of individuals throughout Europe were involved in saving the Jews,

4
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:28,027
but in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,
a small remote village in south central France,
the entire community joined in the rescue efforts.

5
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:32,923
Most of the villagers of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon were descendants of the Huguenots.

6
00:00:32,923 --> 00:00:37,664
The Huguenots were Protestants who once endured persecution in Catholic France.

7
00:00:37,664 --> 00:00:40,477
They never wanted to forget their own history.

8
00:00:40,477 --> 00:00:45,061
A pastor named André Trocmé saw the Jews as the Bible's people.

9
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:46,624
He began hiding them.

10
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:51,104
Hundreds of families aligned themselves with his parish and agreed to help.

11
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:54,230
The residents cooperated in several ways.

12
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,085
They risked their lives by hiding the Jews from Nazi patrols.

13
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:04,597
They offered shelter in their own homes, barns, and public buildings such as orphanages and schools.

14
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:08,608
They forged identification papers to enable Jews to escape.

15
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:13,349
They guided a number of refugees across the border by rail and on foot.

16
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:22,048
The refugees had to travel through underground tunnels and mountain passages to the safety of Switzerland, which was a neutral country during the war.

17
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:26,112
The village received support from people in other places as well.

18
00:01:26,112 --> 00:01:31,894
There was an extensive underground network of individuals throughout the region who helped along the way.

19
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:40,672
Even when the Germans were outraged and raided the village and detained people thought to be helping the Jews, the villagers defied authorities.

20
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:43,146
They did not betray each other, either.

21
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:49,867
They continued to protect the refugee and, by doing so, were able to continue to provide an exit to safety. 

22
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:54,972
The inhabitants provided refuge for an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 Jews.

23
00:01:54,972 --> 00:02:04,297
Today, the village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon is seen as an exceptional example of a collective rescue effort during a truly dark time
