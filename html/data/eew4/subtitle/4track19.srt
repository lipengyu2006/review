The North Star

2
00:00:04,654 --> 00:00:11,057
Among the multitude of stars in the universe, there are a couple that are of great importance to people.

3
00:00:11,057 --> 00:00:16,991
The sun, of course, is one of them. The other is known as Polaris, the North Star.

4
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:23,113
Polaris is special because it is the only star that always appears to be in the same place in the sky.

5
00:00:23,113 --> 00:00:26,455
Therefore, Polaris is a great compass.

6
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:32,858
When people in the northern hemisphere of Earth look toward Polaris, they can be certain that they are facing north.

7
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:38,574
The permanence of Polaris in the north sky has helped countless people find their destinations.

8
00:00:38,574 --> 00:00:44,009
Before the invention of modern navigation tools, mariners relied on Polaris.

9
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:48,100
Their technique was to look for Polaris to figure out their place at sea.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,973
They figured out the angle between the star and the horizon to determine their latitude.

11
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:57,814
As long as the equations weren't erroneous, the results were very reliable.

12
00:00:57,814 --> 00:01:02,031
Polaris also lets sailors determine North, South, East, and West.

13
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:07,653
By knowing directions and their location, mariners could easily navigate their ships.

14
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:12,962
To those who sail at night, wild storms and dark clouds were more than nuisances.

15
00:01:12,962 --> 00:01:16,960
They could disrupt entire journeys by blocking the view of Polaris.

16
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,364
A captain could err and make an inadvertent turn, deviating from the correct course.

17
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:29,829
The ship could become stranded at sea, and the frantic captain would have no way to improvise to get the ship back on the right course.

18
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:35,670
The mariner's fears wouldn't be soothed until the clouds cleared and Polaris came back into view.

19
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,635
Even today, sailors sometimes choose to navigate by using Polaris on clear nights.

20
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:45,602
It's not difficult to differentiate Polaris from other stars.

21
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:51,130
The Big Dipper, which is well known in astrology, appears to revolve around Polaris.

22
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,253
The handle of the Big Dipper always points to the North Star.

23
00:01:55,253 --> 00:02:01,969
When people get lost, it's comforting to know that their problems can be solved by looking at the sky.
