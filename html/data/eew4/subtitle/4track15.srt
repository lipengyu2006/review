Microchips

2
00:00:04,918 --> 00:00:10,487
The bond between humans and computers is becoming more intimate than ever before.

3
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:14,753
Scientists are now even putting microchips inside people's bodies.

4
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:20,381
They are made up of compressed electrical circuits that can detect and record data about the body.

5
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:25,329
They are tiny, but they hold the equivalent amount of data as some computers.

6
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:29,624
A microchip is put to use inside a person with a simple procedure.

7
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:33,653
First, a doctor must put data about the patient onto a chip.

8
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:39,430
Input about the person's age, race, gender, and medical history is stored on the chip.

9
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,874
The second phase of the process involves putting it under the person's skin.

10
00:00:43,874 --> 00:00:49,324
The doctor pinches a piece of skin and cuts a tiny hole with a tool shaped like a spiral.

11
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:52,761
The chip is inserted, and the skin is allowed to heal.

12
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:56,286
Lastly, it begins sending data to the database.

13
00:00:56,286 --> 00:01:01,470
Microchips scan the patientâ€™s body to record what is happening on the quantum level.

14
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,292
They can find problems with the person's metabolism and organs.

15
00:01:05,292 --> 00:01:07,988
They can also detect viral infections.

16
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:14,090
They can find the aggregate number of immune and infected cells and present the results in a ratio.

17
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,652
They can even tell doctors what type of antibiotic to give to the patient!

18
00:01:18,652 --> 00:01:23,748
To recover the chip's data, the doctor uses a special magnet that copies it.

19
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:28,162
This way, the doctor can put the information from the chip onto a computer.

20
00:01:28,162 --> 00:01:31,954
Then, they can find out exactly what is wrong with the person.

21
00:01:31,954 --> 00:01:35,390
The idea of putting chips in people is still very new.

22
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,879
However, it is now becoming more prevalent.

23
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:42,322
Scientists and doctors are hopeful about the future uses of microchips.

24
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:46,825
Someday, all new babies might get a microchip soon after they are born.

25
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:50,943
Doctors will be able to know about any problems from the very beginning.

26
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:55,387
It is obvious that medicine and computers complement each other well.
