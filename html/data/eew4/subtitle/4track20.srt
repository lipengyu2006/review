00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:05,538
Dressed to Excess

2
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:13,171
If you traveled back in time to the 1700s in Europe, you would laugh when you saw how the aristocracy dressed.

3
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:19,195
Soon you'd realize, though, that the aristocrats of Europe were very serious about their appearance.

4
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:24,021
Their appearance was one way of denoting their rank in the social hierarchy.

5
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:28,062
The predominant style in women's attire was enormous dresses.

6
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:31,467
They were often three times larger than the wearer.

7
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:36,705
Ladies even used pads to enlarge the appearance of their hips and shoulders.

8
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:42,505
On the other extreme, the aristocratic women made their waists appear extremely thin.

9
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:49,390
It took several maids stretching fabric and pulling straps in order to get a lady's waist to the proper thinness.

10
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,206
These ladies could barely breathe and often fainted.

11
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:58,482
Pale skin was also a craze, yet this too was done in excess.

12
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:04,094
One could not simply be pale. Instead, she needed to look as if she was ill.

13
00:01:04,094 --> 00:01:09,819
In order to look paler, ladies actually cut themselves daily so they would bleed.

14
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:14,758
The hairstyles, however, were the most striking part of women's fashion.

15
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:18,050
These stood a meter high on the ladies' heads.

16
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:25,534
The columns of hair were a ridiculous tangle of wigs, jewels, flowers, and even stuffed birds.

17
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:29,425
Their partners, the men, were similarly absurd.

18
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:32,942
Today, they would probably seem very feminine.

19
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:36,609
Reputable men wore wigs of long curly hair.

20
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:43,606
Their shoes had large soles or high heels so that they could walk high above the filth on the streets.

21
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:49,592
Furthermore, just like the ladies, the men wore lipstick and painted their cheeks red.

22
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:53,559
Their clothes were brightly colored, often purple and pink.

23
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:58,722
They were made from the finest of fabrics and decorated with jewels and lace.

24
00:01:58,722 --> 00:02:07,590
The men competed with one another to see who wore the more expensive clothes, for the clothing signified wealth and status.

25
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:16,644
Both men and women spent huge amounts of money and time on how they looked, but it was part of the protocol they were expected to follow.

26
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:26,822
Though such vanity would seem strange today, three hundred years from now, the fashions of our time might also seem completely ridiculous.
