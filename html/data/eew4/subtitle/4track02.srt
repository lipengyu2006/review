Enhanced Weathering

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:12,192
Air pollution is not only a contributor to global warming but also to poor air quality.

3
00:00:12,192 --> 00:00:15,232
It can have negative effects on human health.

4
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:23,080
Carbon dioxide is the leading pollutant,
with billions of metric tons emitted annually by the burning of fossil fuels.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,982
Burning less fossil fuels is the obvious way to reduce carbon dioxide.

6
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:35,303
Unfortunately, a tremendous number of people rely on fossil fuels for heating, electricity, and transport.

7
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:41,135
This has prompted scientists to look for different approaches to reducing carbon dioxide.

8
00:00:41,135 --> 00:00:48,332
Weathering is when chemical compounds in the atmosphere react with chemical compounds on the planet's surface.

9
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:52,489
The weathering of rocks refers to the chemical breakdown of rocks.

10
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:58,755
This occurs when rain, which contains carbon from the atmosphere, comes in contact with rocks.

11
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:01,919
The carbon is captured and embedded in the rocks.

12
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:08,155
This is a natural process and can substantially remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

13
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:12,157
However, this process is extremely slow.

14
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:16,220
Scientists have been studying ways to integrate this process.

15
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,912
They have discovered a technique to speed up weathering.

16
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:22,921
They call this enhanced weathering.

17
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:27,761
Certain types of rock, such as olivine, are crushed into a fine powder.

18
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:31,886
The powder is spread over a large land surface to be rained on.

19
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:38,773
This process decreases the time of natural weathering by maximizing the rocks' exposure to carbon.

20
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:41,162
There are skeptics, however.

21
00:01:41,162 --> 00:01:45,288
Some people are uncertain about the effects of enhanced weathering.

22
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:48,142
Some even object to this approach.

23
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:54,936
Rocks such as olivine may contain toxic substances that can contribute to polluting the planet.

24
00:01:54,936 --> 00:01:58,410
Also, grinding rocks produces dust.

25
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,419
The dust can be harmful to human health.

26
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:08,213
Moreover, the process of crushing and transporting rock may cause additional carbon emissions.

27
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:14,572
Although more data needs to be collected,
scientists have not completely rejected enhanced weathering.

28
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:20,001
They are hopeful that it will enable the safe removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

29
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:27,726
Scientists are working together to help improve air quality, combat global warming, and heal our planet.
