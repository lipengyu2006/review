00:00:02,165 --> 00:00:05,454
The Corrupt Administrator

2
00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:12,859
Mr. Watson is an administrator at a big factory that made different kinds of merchandise.

3
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:19,570
During a meeting at the companyâ€™s headquarters, his bosses said they wanted the factory to make more money.

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:25,986
"If the factory makes more money, then you will too," his boss, Mr. Johnson told him.

5
00:00:25,986 --> 00:00:33,017
It was a great incentive. Mr. Watson had always wanted to be as affluent as his bosses.

6
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:37,482
Mr. Watson returned to the factory and started making changes.

7
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:43,791
However, most of his changes were not very nice, and some were not legitimate.

8
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:47,026
First, he fired all his employees.

9
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:50,421
Then, he automated the entire factory.

10
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:55,420
Machines now made everything, and his employees had no jobs.

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:02,131
Next, he bribed some corrupt senators into legislating special subsidies for the factory.

12
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:12,397
Finally, instead of paying a company to dispose of the factory's rubbish properly, he violated the law by throwing it into the river to save money.

13
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:17,877
At first, all the changes to the factory's infrastructure created more revenue.

14
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:22,957
But soon many stores could no longer sell the factory's goods at retail.

15
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:27,662
It seemed that the machines couldn't make products as well as the workers.

16
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:31,325
The customers were disappointed with the factory's merchandise.

17
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,650
There were other problems, too.

18
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,730
The workers had told their friends and family to stop buying the factory's goods.

19
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,072
Officials discovered the factory's rubbish in the river, 

20
00:01:42,072 --> 00:01:49,985
and when they audited the company, they discovered that Mr. Watson had manipulated the law in order to get more money.

21
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:54,049
All transactions with Mr. Watson's factory stopped.

22
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:58,567
The factory lost money, and Mr. Watson lost his job.

23
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:01,561
He realized his mistakes too late.

24
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:10,009
He had tried to become rich by saving money any way possible, but the cheapest way is not always the best.
