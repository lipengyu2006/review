The Bachelor's Lesson

2
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:09,401
A keen young bachelor had finished his studies at the university.

3
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:14,588
He had completed his studies in the minimum time and was about to start looking for a job.

4
00:00:14,588 --> 00:00:20,125
As soon as he had received his diploma, he thought that he was the smartest person in town.

5
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:25,501
"I excel at everything I study," he said, bragging about his knowledge.

6
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:27,446
"I've mastered psychology.

7
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:32,093
I even understand the great theoretical teachings of science, such as relativity.

8
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:34,470
There is nothing that I don't know.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:44,060
Whether it's the movements of celestial objects, like planets and stars, or how to use the power of radioactive substances, I know everything.

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,545
But actually, there was something the bachelor did not know.

11
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:54,325
Although his analytic abilities were great, he failed to notice he was missing something very important in his life.

12
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:59,917
One day while walking through town, the bachelor witnessed a collision between two cars.

13
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:04,833
Both drivers appeared to be injured, but the scholar only stood and watched.

14
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:11,506
He thought to himself, "Those idiots should have been more alert. They really must not be very competent." 

15
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:14,234
He never thought the drivers needed help.

16
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:18,692
"Please help me," said the female driver in a weak voice.

17
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:24,067
"Help me, too," said the male driver. "I'm hurt and can't move."

18
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:29,497
Suddenly, the bachelor realized he was the only person in the area near the accident.

19
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:34,333
He quit thinking and ran to help the drivers using his medical knowledge.

20
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:38,871
He carefully helped them out of their vehicles and then called an ambulance.

21
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:44,706
The drivers were saved, and furthermore the bachelor felt the best he had in his entire life.

22
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:49,785
Studying sociology and geology didn't give him this wonderful feeling.

23
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:55,998
It was the act of helping others, not his cognitive skills, that gave him this great feeling.

24
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:58,429
He had learned an important lesson.

25
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:03,643
He learned that intellect isn't everything; being helpful is just as important.

26
00:02:03,643 --> 00:02:07,182
"Having only a brain is not enough," he thought.

27
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:11,396
"An integral part of being alive is also having a heart."
