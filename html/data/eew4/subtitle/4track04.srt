Women in Tech

2
00:00:05,053 --> 00:00:08,250
The digital economy is soaring.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:15,285
There are over seven million jobs in the computer science and technology industries in the United States alone.

4
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:20,214
Yet there is still a major gender gap when it comes to women in tech.

5
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:26,230
These women face many challenges, as seen in a quit rate of 41 percent.

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,915
So what can be done to close this gender gap?

7
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:33,690
How can we ensure fair pay and equal opportunities?

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:45,356
First, women need to be inspired and motivated to enter the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as well as computer science.

9
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:53,841
According to statistics, 74 percent of young women express interest in STEM subjects and computer science.

10
00:00:53,841 --> 00:01:02,731
However, women hold only 18 percent of undergraduate computer science degrees and 26 percent of tech jobs.

11
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:10,654
Early education must convey technology as a tool that can be applied to real life to solve problems.

12
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:17,392
Many young women are put off because they view the technology sector to be too male-dominated.

13
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:23,694
Women lack prominent roles, holding only a mere five percent of tech leadership positions.

14
00:01:23,694 --> 00:01:31,835
Therefore, women who are already in tech positions must act as mentors and endorse other women in these fields.

15
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:38,448
They can play a huge role for young women by giving them encouragement, support, and guidance.

16
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:45,124
These women can help attract and retain more women and, therefore, create a level-playing field.

17
00:01:45,124 --> 00:01:49,803
However, it is not just the women in tech who must be vocal.

18
00:01:49,803 --> 00:01:57,695
Men working in the tech industry have a responsibility to listen to women and foster a comfortable work culture.

19
00:01:57,695 --> 00:02:06,055
The leaders in the industry have the power to create new opportunities and promote the inclusion of women to close this gender gap.

20
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:15,538
There must be a systematic approach from schools to workplaces, including the motivation of young women to study STEM and computer science.

21
00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:22,401
Women must provide support and mentorship, and men must listen to and encourage women.

22
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:28,827
If we continue to empower women in the tech sector, it will be good for everyone.
