The Ketogenic Diet

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,276
Many diets come and go.

3
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:12,962
One diet that has gained a significant following is the ketogenic diet.

4
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:18,450
This diet is a low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein, high-fat diet.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,403
Many swear by it, claiming that it has improved their overall health.

6
00:00:23,403 --> 00:00:31,887
Known health benefits are weight loss, diabetes management, increased mental focus and energy, and epilepsy control.

7
00:00:31,887 --> 00:00:35,832
An average person's main energy source is glucose.

8
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:41,379
When food that is high in carbohydrates is consumed, the body produces glucose.

9
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:47,341
Since glucose is used for energy, fats are not needed and are, therefore, stored.

10
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:56,477
By lowering the intake of carbohydrates and increasing fat intake, the body goes into a metabolic state known as ketosis.

11
00:00:56,477 --> 00:01:04,248
This is when the liver breaks down fats and produces ketones, which then become the main energy source.

12
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:09,261
The body then becomes extremely efficient at burning fat for energy.

13
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:15,045
Therefore, the goal of a ketogenic diet is to keep your body in this state.

14
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:22,461
In a ketogenic diet, carbs are strictly limited and should come from vegetables, nuts, and dairy.

15
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:27,503
Refined carbs, such as wheat, starch, and fruit, are not allowed.

16
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:34,681
This means pasta, bread, potatoes, and beans as well as all fruit are to be avoided.

17
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:47,377
The majority of meals should include meat, fatty fish, eggs, leafy greens, dairy, and healthy oils such as olive oil, coconut oil, and avocado.

18
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:53,873
A ketogenic diet has a lot of positive benefit; however, there are side effects.

19
00:01:53,873 --> 00:02:00,754
Some include cramping, constipation, heart palpitations, and reduced physical performance.

20
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:07,161
As a precaution, you should always check with your doctor before you start any form of dieting.

21
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:15,585
In summary, eating more fat, a moderate amount of protein, and few carbohydrates will put your body into ketosis.

22
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:18,848
Your body will use up the fat as energy.

23
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:24,781
This diet can be a powerful tool for good health and weight loss.
