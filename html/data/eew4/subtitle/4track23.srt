Dangerous Bites

2
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:10,522
There are many animals with dangerous bites in the world, but which one is the worst?

3
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:13,565
People assume snakes are the most dangerous.

4
00:00:13,565 --> 00:00:17,970
Some would say that the elusive short-tailed mamushi has the worst bite.

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,249
The snake only goes into homes in pursuit of pests such as mice.

6
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:27,257
Otherwise, it stays in the fields, where it's dangerous to people who search for food there.

7
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:35,370
Usually, it is reluctant to attack humans, but if someone stuns it by accidentally stepping on it, it bites to protect itself.

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,329
At first, the effects of the bite may seem minor and negligible because it doesn't cause a lot of bleeding.

9
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:47,763
However, after a few moments, the venom induces paralysis in the area where the individual was bitten.

10
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:51,439
Furthermore, the venom can also interfere with breathing.

11
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,732
If the person doesn't go to the doctor, they are susceptible to kidney deterioration.

12
00:00:56,732 --> 00:01:00,060
Others would argue that tigers have the worst bite.

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:06,716
Mother tigers are inseparable from their babies and seem to be the gentlest creatures when they are around their young.

14
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:13,213
However, if the babies are threatened, the mother tiger's savage nature prevails to ensure their safety.

15
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:19,330
With strong jaws and the ability to move quickly, the tiger can kill someone with one bite.

16
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,703
That's because it always tries to bite an important artery when it attacks.

17
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:27,475
If the artery is ruptured, the victim will bleed to death.

18
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:31,563
In the mainstream, animal bites are seen as the most dangerous.

19
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:34,606
But some scientists think this idea is invalid.

20
00:01:34,606 --> 00:01:38,853
In fact, the most dangerous bite might be the human bite.

21
00:01:38,853 --> 00:01:45,540
When scientists magnified the contents in human Saliva, they found about three hundred different microbes in it.

22
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,721
A human bite can be dangerous if the bacteria enters the body through a cut, which can make people very sick.

23
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:58,567
Furthermore, most people don't realize how serious a human bite can be, so they don't go to the doctor right away.

24
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:03,860
This gives the wound a chance to get infected and cause more problems.
