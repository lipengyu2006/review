Greek Magical Papyri

2
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:10,529
The Greek Magical Papyri is a collection of writing about magic.

3
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:15,716
After it was found in the Egyptian desert, it took experts years to interpret it.

4
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:19,833
The text was written in at least three different ancient languages.

5
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:27,188
After many years, experts realized the document contained a number of spells that varied greatly in scope.

6
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:33,034
The most common types of magic in the collection dealt with healing illnesses like pneumonia.

7
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:39,980
Some spells also gave advice for treating people with mental illnesses, such as those who became psychotic.

8
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,821
Some spells utilized unusual things, like crocodile dung.

9
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,995
But botany was an important part of the magic.

10
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:54,313
Many healing spells gave instructions on how to use herbs and plants that were believed to be helpful.

11
00:00:54,313 --> 00:01:01,416
For example, in order to cure arthritis, the book says that the magician should build a beautiful altar.

12
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:06,382
Then he should crush different types of herbs and place them on top of it.

13
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:11,537
At dusk, he is supposed to say a spell so the gods would be gratified.

14
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:20,149
Other parts of the collection describe how to hone one's psychic abilities and how to give credible descriptions of the future.

15
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:26,970
Often, the book advised people how to use different objects to tell the future, including tea leaves.

16
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,873
Also, one part of the book tells what different dreams might mean.

17
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:35,330
It gives advice for using dreams to tell the future.

18
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,234
A small part of the book, however, has more sinister motives than the rest.

19
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:43,471
It is meant to cause strife and deception.

20
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:51,234
For example, one tells how to give someone warts, while another will make all of the victim's farm animals die.

21
00:01:51,234 --> 00:02:02,707
However, if someone's farm animals died as a result of a curse, he could ask a magician to perform magic that makes the deceased recover and come back to life.
