Anzac Day

2
00:00:05,143 --> 00:00:11,582
April 25th is Anzac Day, Australia's national day of commemoration.

3
00:00:11,582 --> 00:00:18,059
It is a day to remember the Australian soldiers who served and sacrificed their lives for their country. 

4
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:29,260
Anzac Day marks the anniversary of when the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) mobilized and landed on Turkey's Gallipoli Peninsula.

5
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,490
It was just nine months after the outbreak of World War I.

6
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:40,043
The objective of this joint mission was for the troops to capture what is now present-day Istanbul.

7
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:46,443
At the time, Istanbul was the capital of the Ottoman Empire and an ally of Germany.

8
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:53,949
The campaign involved fierce fighting for months and ended without victory at the end of 1915.

9
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:58,369
Over 8,000 Australian soldiers lost their lives.

10
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:06,408
By the end of the war, 60,000 were killed and over 150,000 were wounded or taken prisoner.

11
00:01:06,408 --> 00:01:10,484
Thus, April 25th became a day of remembrance.

12
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:15,856
However, Anzac Day now goes beyond the day of the Gallipoli landing.

13
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:24,010
Now, it is a day to pay tribute to all Australians who served and died in any military operation.

14
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:32,468
Every year on April 25th at 5:30 AM, formal commemorative services are held across the nation.

15
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:36,087
This is usually referred to as the Dawn Service.

16
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:45,003
The service includes praying, laying wreaths of red poppies, observing a period of silence, and singing the national anthem.

17
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:50,336
During the day, former servicemen and women march through major cities.

18
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,280
People wear sprigs of rosemary on their coats to symbolize remembering and remembrance.

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,024
Rosemary has particular significance because it grows wild across the Gallipoli Peninsula.

20
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:09,310
Anzac Day was originally set to commemorate the anniversary of the landing in Gallipoli.

21
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:20,892
But it is now a day to celebrate the courage, determination, and perseverance of the Australians who served and died in all wars and peacekeeping operations.

22
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:29,198
Anzac Day is also a day of unity as people share their sorrow for the many lives lost in wars.
