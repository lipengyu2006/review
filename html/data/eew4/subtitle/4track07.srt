Endangered Languages

2
00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:09,125
Most people know about endangered plants and animals.

3
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:14,427
However, not everyone is aware of the extent to which many languages are in danger of extinction.

4
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:18,920
Currently, there are almost 500 languages that are officially endangered.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:28,324
According to statistics, 95 percent of the world's population only speak six percent of the existing 7,000 languages.

6
00:00:28,324 --> 00:00:32,621
This means that only six percent speak all the other languages.

7
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:36,165
Some languages have fewer than a dozen speakers.

8
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:40,016
There are several reasons why languages become extinct.

9
00:00:40,016 --> 00:00:43,672
A key reason is the influence of the dominant languages.

10
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:49,225
Generally, dominant languages are associated with higher social status and education.

11
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:53,662
People who move to urban areas are forced to learn the dominant language.

12
00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:57,569
In most cases, the children do not learn their native language.

13
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:04,880
In addition, many rural communities give up their linguistic heritage in an attempt to assimilate into mainstream culture.

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,717
For example, India has lost 220 of 780 languages in the last 50 years.

15
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:21,847
Once Hindi was recognized as the official language of India, the number of Hindi speakers increased from 260 million to over 420 million.

16
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:31,502
Another reason languages may cease to exist is that the people who speak an endangered language may be in physical danger, such as from war or genocide.

17
00:01:31,502 --> 00:01:38,032
Many languages of the indigenous people in the Americas are either extinct or endangered for this very reason.

18
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:42,971
Natural disasters and disease can also wipe out entire populations.

19
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:48,831
When the people in a village of Papua New Guinea were hit by a devastating earthquake, all were wiped out.

20
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:52,878
The language they spoke, Malol, was wiped out with them.

21
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:56,533
Languages represent cultures and show diversity.

22
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:02,058
Losing a language equates to losing all cultural references expressed through linguistic means.

23
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:07,863
The broader global community suffers because of the diminishing cultural and linguistic diversity.

24
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:15,872
Therefore, efforts need to be made to preserve and revive endangered languages before they disappear forever.
