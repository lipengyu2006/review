Social Media

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:11,447
All around the world, people who have mobile devices are likely to have a presence on social media.

3
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:21,007
However, data reveals a link between social media use and a surge in health issues.
Anxiety and depression are two such issues.

4
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:27,143
Research suggests that social media use may be correlated to lower self-control.

5
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:31,805
Lower self-control often causes poor or addictive behavior.

6
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:37,056
Social media has been described to be more addictive than tobacco and alcohol.

7
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:43,606
People may rely on social media as a form of escapism and for mood-modifying effects.

8
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:48,504
These are similar to the reasons people become dependent on addictive substances.

9
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:55,113
Surveys about social media show that a surprising number of teenagers have been subjected to cyberbullying.

10
00:00:55,113 --> 00:01:04,731
Cyberbullies can easily remain anonymous.
They are accountable to no one, so they use social media to target victims and spread rumors.

11
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:10,041
This has become so common that the term "keyboard warrior" has been coined.

12
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:15,234
A keyboard warrior's agenda is to write abusive posts while staying hidden.

13
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:18,243
The effects of cyberbullying can be traumatic.

14
00:01:18,243 --> 00:01:22,256
There are other negative effects of social media's popularity.

15
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:27,448
People sometimes use social networking platforms to show their best selves.

16
00:01:27,448 --> 00:01:34,470
A recent social media trend is to upload and broadcast video clips to share a piece of one's life.

17
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:41,433
However, instead of feeling accepted and validated, people end up comparing their lives with other people.

18
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:46,331
This trap of comparing lives may lead to symptoms of depression.

19
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:51,464
Social media use has also been linked to feelings of social isolation.

20
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:59,194
The more people use social media, 
the more they realize that their digital friends may not actually be real friends.

21
00:01:59,194 --> 00:02:04,505
This feeling of isolation may cause a person to experience extreme loneliness.

22
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:09,756
We see social media used in the personal and professional lives of those around us.

23
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:12,323
It's apparent that it's here to stay.

24
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:20,820
Therefore, it's necessary to consider the importance of educating people on how to use social media effectively and safely.
