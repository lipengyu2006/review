Preparing for Future

2
00:00:04,862 --> 00:00:10,064
Overpopulation is a big problem in every region of the world today.

3
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:14,042
Too many people are crammed into cities and towns around the globe.

4
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:17,816
Earth's population is about 6.5 billion people.

5
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:20,230
This number is growing every day.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:27,812
Notwithstanding improvements in birth control, in just 50 years, the population will be almost 9 billion.

7
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:32,810
Many people worry that the Earth won't have enough resources to support so many people.

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:39,440
One major reason for this is that wasting resources and polluting have become habitual behaviors.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,826
Industrial output results in polluting the air with dangerous fumes.

10
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:49,402
Also, cars and machines waste important natural resources like oil and water.

11
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:55,964
It's possible that the Earth may become so damaged that it cannot support a large population of humans.

12
00:00:55,964 --> 00:01:00,282
Another issue is the lack of useful land for cultivating crops.

13
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:05,348
Even today, many people subsist on mere scraps of food and little water.

14
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:10,788
In 50 years, many experts worry that huge numbers of people will starve to death.

15
00:01:10,788 --> 00:01:14,154
So, what is being done to prepare for the future?

16
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:20,818
People are realizing they can no longer justify their wasteful behavior or defer action to fix it.

17
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:25,238
Many car companies already have patents for very efficient cars.

18
00:01:25,238 --> 00:01:29,998
Such cars waste no resources and produce no pollution.

19
00:01:29,998 --> 00:01:35,370
A conversion to clean cars means that petroleum can be saved for the future.

20
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:42,136
In addition, the environmental sectors of many governments are setting strict rules for industries that pollute too much.

21
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:47,202
If companies do not keep to these standards, they are penalized with higher taxes.

22
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:51,622
In some cases, their operations might be suspended altogether.

23
00:01:51,622 --> 00:01:54,410
Food is also an issue that is being tackled.

24
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:59,170
Many countries are now subscribing to the point of view that immediate action is needed.

25
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,270
They are determining ways to export goods to people in need, so that no one goes hungry.

26
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:13,008
Experts will continue to come up with ideas for the future, and a synthesis of these ideas will help to support the growing population.
