The End of Smallpox

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:10,302
Smallpox was once the most deadly widespread disease in the world.

3
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:15,266
During the 1800s, more than 20 million people got the disease every year.

4
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,986
Of those, nearly half died.

5
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:24,650
At the onset of smallpox, people suffered from high fevers, headaches, vomiting, and aching muscles.

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,478
Yet, the worst symptom of all was the irritation over the entire body.

7
00:00:29,478 --> 00:00:36,482
Those who survived the disease were often rendered blind or left with gross scars on their face and body.

8
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:43,520
Today, however, cases of smallpox are very rare due to the work of many countries during the late 1900s.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,824
This federation of countries collaborated to completely destroy smallpox.

10
00:00:48,824 --> 00:00:56,746
Early in the century, wealthy countries in Europe and North America had developed a substance that made the body immune to smallpox.

11
00:00:56,746 --> 00:01:01,234
They had required all their citizens to get this vaccine to fight the disease.

12
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:05,960
Hence, the people of these countries no longer had to worry about smallpox.

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,080
However, many of the needy people in poorer parts of the world still suffered from the disease.

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,812
Their countries could not afford the vaccine nor supply enough doctors to curb the spread of smallpox.

15
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:24,898
In 1950, the wealthier countries of the world vowed to rid the world of the disease.

16
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:27,924
They worked out a coherent strategy to do this.

17
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:32,276
They pledged to supply the vaccine to any country that could not afford it.

18
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:36,594
Scientists compiled lists of areas where the disease still thrived.

19
00:01:36,594 --> 00:01:41,082
Then doctors diagnosed people who had the disease in these areas.

20
00:01:41,082 --> 00:01:46,590
They enacted laws that prohibited people with smallpox from mixing with those who did not.

21
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,398
In this way, they could not transmit the disease to others.

22
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:53,628
Then the doctors gave all of them the vaccine.

23
00:01:53,628 --> 00:01:56,382
It took a long time and a lot of work.

24
00:01:56,382 --> 00:02:05,120
But nearly thirty years later, on December 9, 1979, a group of scientists certified that smallpox had been successfully stopped.

25
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:13,246
The humane efforts of people from all over the world had accomplished a great task and transformed people's lives.
