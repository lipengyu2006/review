Amazing Komodo Dragons

2
00:00:05,548 --> 00:00:09,406
Once, a British gazette had an unusual story.

3
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:14,061
Scientists at a zoo made a major discovery about komodo dragons.

4
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:18,684
Komodo dragons are giant lizards that grow up to two and a half meters long.

5
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:21,394
A female lizard at the zoo had babies.

6
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:25,348
However, it had never been around a male lizard in its entire life.

7
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:32,299
After the scientists publicized their discovery, many people thought it was not true. But it was true.

8
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:38,580
It was discovered that female komodo dragons can have babies without the help of their male counterparts.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,586
This contradicts what scientists know about how most animals have babies.

10
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:48,879
In most cases, there are many things that can obstruct this type of reproduction.

11
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,427
For example, adult males and females carry different genes needed to make an embryo.

12
00:00:54,427 --> 00:00:59,464
If the genes are homogeneous, the babies are weaker and have genetic problems.

13
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:03,418
Over time, the weakened species dies out completely.

14
00:01:03,418 --> 00:01:06,638
This makes it necessary for the male to be involved.

15
00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:14,227
However, scientists verified that when Komodo babies are born, their genes aren't the exact same genes as their mother.

16
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:18,244
Also, they are devoid of any genetic problems.

17
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:24,557
Scientists theorize that Komodo dragons developed the ability because it helps the species avoid extinction.

18
00:01:24,557 --> 00:01:29,754
If a volcano erupts, lava can kill all of the komodo dragons on an island.

19
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:35,972
However, as long as an individual female avoids death, she can prolong the survival of the species.

20
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:38,969
Luckily, Komodo dragons are vigorous swimmers.

21
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:44,166
So, the surviving female can plunge into the ocean and swim to another island.

22
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:48,216
When she comes ashore, she can reproduce by herself.

23
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:51,850
Over time, the genes within the population diverge.

24
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,561
Then, the small population increases.

25
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:57,781
Finally, there is a surplus of lizards on one island.

26
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:04,827
Scientists think that this may be how the lizards survived and took over all of the islands in that area.
