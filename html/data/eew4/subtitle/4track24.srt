00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,216
The Lydian King

2
00:00:05,216 --> 00:00:09,820
King Croesus was once one of the richest kings in the world.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:18,633
He ruled over Lydia, an ancient empire located near modern-day Turkey, and controlled a valuable commodity: gold.

4
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:21,654
Many people were very envious of him.

5
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:29,820
One day, a messenger disclosed some interesting news: political unrest in Persia had weakened the empire.

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,993
Before then, the Persians had taken over many countries.

7
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:37,302
Many leaders were scared of the Persian conquest.

8
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:41,942
But King Croesus understood the dynamics of war better than most.

9
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:47,518
He decided that it would be a good time to try to beat the Persians while they were weak.

10
00:00:47,518 --> 00:00:52,410
He advocated starting a war, but nobody shared his wishes.

11
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,374
Then he asked a wise member of the senate who was visiting from Athens.

12
00:00:57,374 --> 00:01:01,079
He didn't say whether he should attack the Persians or not.

13
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,323
He only indicated that the king's good luck wouldn't last.

14
00:01:05,323 --> 00:01:12,589
Finally, King Croesus sent a messenger to communicate with the Oracle, a special lady who could see the future.

15
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:19,100
The messenger gave the Oracle jugs of wine and baskets of lentils in order to make her happy.

16
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,129
When the messenger came back, he was in a festive mood.

17
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:27,265
"What was the Oracle's prophecy?" asked King Croesus.

18
00:01:27,265 --> 00:01:34,711
The messenger responded, "She said that if you attack Persia, you will destroy a great empire."

19
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:37,481
The news filled Croesus with happiness.

20
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:43,129
After hearing the Oracle's prophecy, many civilians enrolled in the Lydian army.

21
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:47,841
The king marshaled his troops and prepared them for a war with Persia.

22
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:51,798
Their morale was high because they were sure they would win.

23
00:01:51,798 --> 00:01:56,438
Soon, King Croesus authorized an attack against the Persians.

24
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:00,467
However, the Persian army was still very strong.

25
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:06,114
After a few months of fighting, it was obvious that the Oracle's prophecy had come true, 

26
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:14,891
albeit not in the expected way: by attacking the Persians, King Croesus had destroyed a great empire â€“ his own!

27
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:21,114
King Croesus should have considered the ambiguous advice more carefully.
