00:00:06,504 --> 00:00:14,180
At any given moment, trillions of cells are traveling through your blood vessels, sometimes circling the body in just one minute.

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,338
Each of these cells has its origins deep in your bones.

3
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:22,744
Bones might seem rock-solid, but they're actually quite porous inside.

4
00:00:22,744 --> 00:00:25,943
Large and small blood vessels enter through these holes.

5
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:31,807
And inside most of the large bones of your skeleton is a hollow core filled with soft bone marrow.

6
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:37,990
Marrow contains fat and other supportive tissue, but its most essential elements are blood stem cells.

7
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,798
These stem cells are constantly dividing.

8
00:00:40,798 --> 00:00:50,429
They can differentiate into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, and send about hundreds of billions of new blood cells into circulation every day.

9
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:55,902
These new cells enter the bloodstream through holes in small capillaries in the marrow.

10
00:00:55,902 --> 00:01:00,770
Through the capillaries, they reach larger blood vessels and exit the bone.

11
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,675
If there's a problem with your blood, there's a good chance it can be traced back to the bone marrow.

12
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:09,762
Blood cancers often begin with genetic mutations in the stem cells.

13
00:01:09,762 --> 00:01:18,468
The stem cells themselves are not cancerous, but these mutations can interfere with the process of differentiation and result in malignant blood cells.

14
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:30,054
So for patients with advanced blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, the best chance for a cure is often an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, which replaces the patient's bone marrow with a donor's.

15
00:01:30,054 --> 00:01:32,044
Here's how it works.

16
00:01:32,044 --> 00:01:35,669
First, blood stem cells are extracted from the donor.

17
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:44,269
Most commonly, blood stem cells are filtered out of the donor's bloodstream by circulating the blood through a machine that separates it into different components.

18
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:51,412
In other cases, the marrow is extracted directly from a bone in the hip, the iliac crest, with a needle.

19
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:54,682
Meanwhile, the recipient prepares for the transplant.

20
00:01:54,682 --> 00:02:02,785
High doses of chemotherapy or radiation kill the patient's existing marrow, destroying both malignant cells and blood stem cells.

21
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:08,542
This also weakens the immune system, making it less likely to attack the transplanted cells.

22
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:13,446
Then the donor cells are infused into the patient's body through a central line.

23
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:24,356
They initially circulate in the recipient's peripheral bloodstream, but molecules on the stem cells, called chemokines, act as homing devices and quickly traffic them back to the marrow.

24
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:30,362
Over the course of a few weeks, they begin to multiply and start producing new, healthy blood cells.

25
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:36,510
Just a small population of blood stem cells can regenerate a whole body's worth of healthy marrow.

26
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,303
A bone marrow transplant can also lead to something called graft-versus-tumor activity,

27
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:49,553
when new immune cells generated by the donated marrow can wipe out cancer cells the recipient's original immune system couldn't.

28
00:02:49,553 --> 00:02:53,178
This phenomenon can help eradicate stubborn blood cancers.

29
00:02:53,178 --> 00:02:59,006
But bone marrow transplants also come with risks, including graft-versus-host disease.

30
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:04,586
It happens when the immune system generated by the donor cells attacks the patient's organs.

31
00:03:04,586 --> 00:03:13,328
This life-threatening condition occurs in about 30â€“50% of patients who receive donor cells from anyone other than an identical twin,

32
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:17,699
particularly when the stem cells are collected from the blood as opposed to the bone marrow.

33
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:27,366
Patients may take immunosuppressant medications or certain immune cells may be removed from the donated sample in order to reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease.

34
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:33,407
But even if a patient avoids graft-versus-host disease, their immune system may reject the donor cells.

35
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:37,494
So it's crucial to find the best match possible in the first place.

36
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:42,931
Key regions of the genetic code determine how the immune system identifies foreign cells.

37
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:50,075
If these regions are similar in the donor and the recipient, the recipient's immune system is more likely to accept the donor cells.

38
00:03:50,075 --> 00:03:54,588
Because these genes are inherited, the best matches are often siblings.

39
00:03:54,588 --> 00:04:00,203
But many patients who need a bone marrow transplant don't have a matched family member.

40
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:05,676
Those patients turn to donor registries of volunteers willing to offer their bone marrow.

41
00:04:05,676 --> 00:04:10,083
All it takes to be on the registry is a cheek swab to test for a genetic match.

42
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:15,129
And in many cases, the donation itself isn't much more complicated than giving blood.

43
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:20,566
It's a way to save someone's life with a resource that's completely renewable.
